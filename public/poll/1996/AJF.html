extremely honorable mentions that don't fit top record rules::

dolly mixture "demonstration tapes" LP - - i found this record this year and
don't know when it was reissued. but this record was and is the best pop record
i have ever heard!!!!

ultra-lounge series on captiol records - - hats off to capitol. this series
kicks the butt of any lounge record series i've heard. great cocktail party
music.

galaxie 500 box set - - my record collection couldn't have done without the
today record out of this box set. period!

favorite live bands of the year ::

damon and naomi, run on, rocketship, henry's dress, holiday, sportsguitar,
neutral milk hotel  and uke fink

well that's my little contribution to the top 20 poll!!
