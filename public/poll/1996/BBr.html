	you need info...forced exposure carries(ed?) this)

	Chamber Orchestra" Agaric	
Bernhard Guenter "un peu de neige salie" Table of the Elements

there are several re-issues that must be recognized.  The oval and microstoria
re-issues on Thrill Jockey are all worthwile.  Also everything released by
Dexters Cigar as of yet has been flawless and exceptionally worthwile, allowing
a whole new generation access to these musics.  Those include Henry Kaiser
"Outside Aloha Pleasure", Loren Mazzacane Connors "In Pittsburg", and most of
all "Aida" by Derek Bailey.  Been listening to Luc Ferrari's "Presque Rein"
(dont know when it came out), I really dont have the space to say what I feel
about this piece.  Also enjoyed the This Heat peel sessions resurfacing...nice
to see how they worked everything out in a live setting...Too many other things
too probably...I rather like the ragnar Grippe Re-issue as well on Streamline
(a fine label--the morphogenesis release is particularly good).  Also realizing
how good u.s. maple really are, and what incredible work jim o'rourke did on
their skin graft record (i know, it was not this year...but, it took me this
long to realize how good it really is).  Also wish I would have been able to
hear the Tony Conrad "4 violins" before this, but...
I should stop now.

all the best,
