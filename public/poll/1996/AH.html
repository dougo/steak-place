Hi Doug,

for your Chug Poll:

&gt;They don't have to be indie or even
&gt;rock, just whatever tickled your fancy.

Ok-

{Of course it's almost random what records one will hear and like in any
given year, but these 20 tickled my fancy in approximate order of
ticklishness:}

1) The Lord Weird Slough Feg "self-titled" Beef Rock Records
2) The Cardigans "First Band On The Moon" Mercury
3) Stinking Lizaveta "...hopelessness and shame" Compulsiv (and live, they
RULE!)
4) Samael "Passage" Century Media
5) Koji Asano "Gravity" Rab
6) Burzum "Filosofem" Misanthropy
7) various artists "Harder Than The Rest" Digital Hardcore Records
8) Dissection "Storm Of The Light's Bane" Nuclear Blast (late 1995, actually)
9) John Zorn's Masada "Bar Kokhba" Tzadik
10) 1.6 Band "Broke Up" Gern Blandsten
11) Cul De Sac "China Gate" Thirsty Ear
12) Squarepusher "Port Rhombus" Warp
13) Crevice "self-titled" Seizure
14) Sun City Girls "303,003 Crossdressers From Beyond The Rig Veda" Abduction
15) Ikue Mori "Garden" Tzadik
16) Black Stage "self-titled" Maboroshi No Sekai
17) Village of Savoonga "Philipp Schatz" Communion
18) Squarepusher "Feed Me Weird Things" Rephlex
19) Soh Band "No Problem At All" Chitei Records
20) Doctor Octagon "self-titled" Bulk

I know there's million (well, maybe a few dozen) other great records that
I'm forgetting, overlooking, or haven't even heard (of) yet...oh well, it's
11:54pm on the 30th, so, these will do...

cheers,
        Allan
