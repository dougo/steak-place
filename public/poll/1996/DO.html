Each group below is in roughly descending order, but the order could
change pretty easily depending on my mood (except for the Top 5 or so).

Top 20:
-------
All of these make me say "wow" and fill me with a sense of inner peace.

Swirlies, _They Spent Their Wild Youthful Days in the Glittering World of the Salons_ (Taang!)
Beak, _Autoselfreplicationalism_ (Insignificant)

Honorable Mentions:
-------------------
These are all "wow" records too, but I had to draw the line somewhere.
If it were Top 50, they'd all be in there...

Wrens, the, _Secaucus_ (Grass/BMG)

Underachievers (i.e. their other records are better) but still really good:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This group is slightly out of sequence (some belong in the Honorable
Mention section, some belong in the Also Recommended section), but it
seemed to make sense to put them together in one category.

Polvo, _Exploded Drawing_ (Touch &amp; Go)

Sone, _Holiday and Sport_ (Darla)
Meices, _Dirty Bird_ (London)

Also Recommended:
-----------------

slightly less than perfect.
