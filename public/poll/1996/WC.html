but the best is saved for last: alas it's not a valid entry on account of
its format, yet the most lovely and stunning music heard this year is on a
fifth-or-sixth gen dub of mixed songs from late 60's early 70's Brazilian
band Os Mutantes. if someone doesn't issue them in this country then i'm
going to have to do it.
