(These are not in any intended order, except that the first two "win". 
Strangely, they're also the only two non-"full-length" releases in the
list.)

DJ Trajic: "Pants R Saggin" 12" - Underground Construction
Leo Bugariloves: "Absintinjuoja" 7" - Bad Vugum
A Minor Forest: "Flemish Altruism (Constituent Parts: '93-'96)" - Thrill Jockey
Polvo: "Exploded Drawing" - Touch and Go
Sepultura: "Roots" - ?
Scissor Girls: "We People Space With Phantoms" - Bulb?
Cajmere: "The Many Sides Of Cajual" - Cajual Records
godheadSilo: "Skyward In Triumph" - SubPop
Spaceheads: "Spaceheads" - Dark Beloved Cloud
Labradford: "Labradford" - Kranky
Merzbow: "Rainbow Electronics 2" - Dexter's Cigar
Gastr del Sol: "Upgrade And Afterlife" - Drag City

I enjoy all these choices, and I heard a lot of music I really liked in the
past year.  However, much of it was older music.  Of the above releases, I
think they're all good but definitely not amazing with the clearly amazing
exceptions of the Leo Bugariloves 7" and the DJ Trajic 12" single.  Also
Sepultura surprised me, and the A Minor Forest album includes the best
set-ending song I've ever heard.  I found Spaceheads original, though it
lacks the punch of Dog Faced Hermans.  Unlike many, I feel Polvo's record
continues their strong tradition yet possibly hints at a surprisingly cool
change of direction.

As usual, many releases might have made my list if only I had heard them:

anything by Radiopuhelimet or on Bad Vugum
1996 releases by Quintron, Lonesome Organist, Xerobot, Mercyful Fate, Cul de
Sac, Brainbombs, Unwound, Faust, Thinking Fellers Union Local 282
Sun City Girls: [double CD with "300,033" in the title] - Abduction
