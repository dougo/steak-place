My list may seem tainted by the fact that I live in Olympia, but I live
here because I like it here, so what can I say? 

I should note that there are three records on this list that I worked
on: both Dub Narcotic Sound System records, and Love as Laughter/The
Greks Bring Gifts (K). Rock agenda in full view: I like them, I think
they belong here.  -Diana Arens.
