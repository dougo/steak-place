reissue d'anee : La Peste s/t  Matador
apologies to: Ruby Falls, Thee Headcoats, Palace, Bardo Pond, the Figgs, 
Tobin Sprout, and the Strapping Fieldhands (20 means 20 so these didn't fit)
bootleg: The Red Krayola _Deliverance_

11 & 20 are local cassettes, and I gues if we are actually going to put 
them out we should give our label a name, but as it stands now if you 
want to hear them the best way to get them is by emailing me, we can 
always make copies of tapes and someone is allegedly getting a CD burner 
so who knows.  I actually will probably send you text to append to this 
top 20 since it seems too fucking weird just making this list and not 
doing anything else with it.
