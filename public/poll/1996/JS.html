The way I judge "best" records these days differs greatly from the criteria
I had about 5 years ago:  nowadays, if it gets played often at work (say,
three or four times a week), then it must be good.

The only problem is that my computer only has a CD player, so I'd say 95
percent of these are CD's.  The rest are stuff I taped at home so I could
listen to it at work.

Not really wanting to demarcate into 7", EP's, etc. I have chosen full
length and non.

Full-length action, in no particular order whatsoever.

Flying Saucer Attack: _In Search Of Spaces_ (Corpus Hermeticum)

V/A _The Miracle of Levitation_ (Gentle Giant) [great US Maple track, IMHO]

Space Streakings/Mount Shasta: _Shakuhachi Surprise_ (Skin Graft)

Omoide Hatoba: _Kinsei_ (Birrrrdman)

Silver Jews: _The Natural Bridge_ (Drag City)

Guided By Voices: _Under the Bushes, Under the Stars_ (Matador)

Danielson: _A Prayer For Every Hour_ (Tooth and Nail)

_Vertigo_ soundtrack

Pelt _Burning/Filament/Rockets_

Tricky _Premillenium Tension_ (Island)



Non-full length action

Palace "Little Blue Eyes"

Shellac compilation appearances: that version of "Jailbreak" (Skin Graft),
"Copper" (on Ground Rule Double [Actionboy], but I sorta hate the vocals)

About 5 songs from Polvo's _Exploded Drawing_ (Touch and Go) because
there's a lot of filler

Edith Frost 2 X 7" (Drag City) [Hidden Agenda Alert: She's my friend]

Porno for Pyros "Tahitian Moon". Working for 7 months in the bullpen of an
ad agency's DTP division made its mark.  The bassline rules.

Blackstreet "No Diggety"

That Superunit 12" that came with the vinyl re-issue of Zeni Geva's
_Nai-Ha_ (Skin Graft)


That's it.  Demographic info: East-coast dwelling female.
