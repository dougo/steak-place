Cardigans *first band on the moon* CD 
John Parish and Polly Jean Harvey *Dance Hall at Louse Point* CD 
Prolapse *backsaturday* CD 
V/A *Succour:  the Terrascope Benefit Album* 2xCD 
Polvo *exploded drawing* CD 
Olivia Tremor Control 2xCD 
Six Finger Satellite *Paranormalized* CD 
Stereolab *Refried Ectoplasm (Switched On Volume 2) CD

Scrawl *Travel On, Rider* CD 
Dr. Octagon CD 
Tricky *Pre-Millenium Tension* CD
DJ Spooky *Songs of a Dead Dreamer* CD
DJ Shadow *Entroducing...* CD

My overwhelming impression while compiling this list was surprise at 
how few new releases there were that I felt honestly enthusiastic about 
(as opposed to "rather liking", or "haven't really properly listened to
yet").
