I didn't buy 20 releases this year, but what little I got was:

Duvalby Bros. -- Sleepytime Medicine Band -- Cambodia/Flexovit
a great cd. highly recommended.

Six Finger Satellite -- Paranormailized -- Sub Pop

Melvins -- Stag -- Atlantic

Bad Brains -- Black Dots

Original Motion Picture Soundtrack -- 2001: A Space Odyssey -- Rhino
an incredible reissue with the versions used in the movie (the orig.
MGM soundtrack used diff. versions, which Rhino also included!) plus a 10
minute track of HAL and some of Georgy Ligeti's pieces used in the movie
that were excluded from the MGM version. stupid major labels.
