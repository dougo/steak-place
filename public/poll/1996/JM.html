For '96:
1) Emancipation by O+-&gt; (NPG Records) (or whatever) this is 3 discs.  The
2nd disc is
terrific.  So is the first half of the first disc and many of the songs on
the third disc.  This is very different from most of Prince's work.  More
mature-- one whole disc is about his joyful anticipation of fatherhood.  

2)Datapanik in the Year Zero by Pere Ubu. 5 discs.  The first two are
early studio albums they are quite good.  The last last two are live
albums and rare/unissued stuff.  They are pretty good.  I haven't really
gotten into the third disc (Middle period studio albums).  

3)New Adventures in Hi-Fi by REM. WB.  1 disc.  This has really grown on
me.  There are about 5 really good songs, and the filler is pleasant at
worst.  

Everything else I bought that came out in '96 was disappointing.  This is,
by my calculations (looking at the copyright on albums I've bought), the
leanest year since the mid sixties.  Hopefully other folks'
recommendations will provide some relief.  In the meantime, I'm buying
lots of old blues re-issues.
