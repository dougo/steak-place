I hope you'll indulge me on the extra couple of lists. They're intended
for the web site (if yer doing that again this year). As usual there are 
many records from 1996 I just havent been able to find (like the latest 
Circle album), which will probably turn up as next years addenda.
        
regards,


Eamonn.
