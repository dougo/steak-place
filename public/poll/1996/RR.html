Honestly, the three albums I listened to more than any others: 
Stereolab, Beck, and Neutral Milk Hotel.

didn't listen to them that much: Sun City Girls- *330,003 
Crossdressers* 
Best lyrics: Handsome Family *Milk and Scissors* (Carrot Top Records)
Best skiffle band: Strapping Field Hands
Finally, an Indie Rock album with a vocalist who can carry a tune: 
Neutral Milk Hotel.
Finally, an Indie Rock album by someone who can't sing worth a damn 
but sure can write a lyric: Silver Jews.
Most brilliant use of beauty: Elvis Costello.
Best Louvin Brothers song not written by them: "By the Marks" by 
Gillian Welch, from her self titled debut (Almo Sounds).
