Hi

Just a short list of records
I HEARD + BOUGHT + ENJOYED in 1996

John Zorn: Bar Kokhba (Masada Chamber Ensembles) (Tzadik)
John Zorn / Masada: Zayin (Seven) (Avant)
Tortoise: Millions now living will never die (Thrill Jockey)
The Walkabouts: Devil's road (Virgin)
Gastr Del Sol: Upgrade and afterlife (Drag City)
Palace Music: Arise therefore (Drag City / Domino)
Bundy K. Brown / Doug Scharin / James Warden: Directions in music 
(Thrill Jockey)
Lambchop: How I quit smoking (City Slang)

Pere Ubu: Datapanik in the year zero (5CD box)


... not very much, but my criteria were quite severe this year ......
and I always tend to buy some of the better stuff only the next year
(after the Chug poll lists have appeared one might notice ...)


bye
