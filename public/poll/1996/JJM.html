Subject: '96 Poll Votes

Hey Doug (and friends who might be interested) -

I'm late by 3 days, I know, but I hope you can squeeze these in . . .

Here are my votes for the hip Chugchanga '96 record poll. They are in no
particular order, as you asked, although the Joe Henry, Afghan Whigs, and
Come never seemed to leave rotation. And I liked Joe Henry best of all.

I'd be very interested to know how many 7"s people vote for. I, for one,
could think of only one that I really liked, and I have suspected that the
format is dying over the past year or so. Are you seeing results consistent
with that theory?

Thanks, and I'll see you out at some rock club one night or another.

Joe Henry - Trampoline
Afghan Whigs - Black Love
Come - Near Life Experience
Palace Music - Arise Therefore
Those Bastard Souls - 20th Century Chemical (?)
Bardo Pond - Amanita
Guided By Voices - Under the Bushes, Under the Stars
Tobin Sprout - Carnival Boy
Appendix/Out - 7"
Steve Earle - I Feel Alright
Gillian Welch - Revival
The Who - Live at the Isle of Wight 1970
Stereolab - Emperor Tomato Ketchup
Stereolab - Refried Ectoplasm
Olivia Tremor Control - Dusk at Cubist Castle
Charalambides - Market Square
Strapping Fieldhands - Wattle and Daub
Gastr Del Sol - Upgrade and Afterlife
Bedhead - Beheaded
David S. Ware - Tao
