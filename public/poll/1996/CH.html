	Here's my start.  Enjoy!  And thanks, as always, for the
	effort...(I wonder if anyone will notice the Marino listing).


Storm of Drones - Misc - Sombient/Asphodel
Tool - Aenima - Zoo
Bad Brains - Black Dots - Caroline
Descendents - Everything Sucks - Epitaph
Steve Roach - Magnificent Void - Fathom
Johnny Cash - Unchained - American
DeepNet - Various - Side Effects
Brain Surgeons - Box of Hammers - Cellsum Records
Sepultura - Roots - RoadRunner
DragonFly -  Frank Marino and Mahoghany Rush - Razor & Tie
Apocolyptica - Plays Metallica (Four Cellos) - Mercury

    [Songs on that last one, for the curious:]
	Sandman
	Master
	Harvester
	Sad but true
	Sanitarium
	Wherever I may roam
	Creeping death (!)
	Unforgiven

	Master of Puppets REALLY stands out.  Makes you realize how
	great those guys once were.

	Plus, I never realized that Sanitarium was Pachabel's Canon in
	disguise. :-)
