Subject:      indie album top 10
Date: Mon, 13 Dec 1993 13:43:22 -0500

Thanks to everyone who responded to my request for top 10 lists, but I must
apologize for not being able to compile a list of top songs as everyone seems
to like different songs even if they are off the same albums so any attempt to
make a list would be utterly feeble.

So without any further ado, a compiled list of the top 10 albums of 1993
   ---according to a CHUGCHANGA survey---

1.) JOHN SPENCER BLUES EXPLOSION _Extra Width_      Matador Records

2.) PJ HARVEY _Rid of Me_                           Island Records

3.) HAZEL _Toreador of Love_                        Sub Pop Records

4.) GRIFTERS _One Sock Missing_                     Shangri La Records

5.) PALACE BROTHERS _There Is No-One What Will Take Care Of You_
                                                    Drag City Records

6.) YO LA TENGO _Painful_                           Matador Records

7.) SEBADOH _Bubble and Scrape_                     Sub Pop Records

8.) AFGHAN WHIGS _Gentleman_                        Elektra Records

9.) POLVO _Today's Active Lifestyles_               Merge Records

10.) BREEDERS _Last Splash_                         Elektra Records
