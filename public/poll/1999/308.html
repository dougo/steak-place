<P>
The need to keep my sugar buzz alive lead to an abundance of confection in my top 20 ... though a few garagey offerings did sneak in there.
<p>
BELLE & SEBASTIAN: the best record of the 90's, and the only one that made me feel 15 again.  
BIRDIE: simple pop elements coming together in a compelling mix of sly female vocals and early 70's basslines.  
JUNE & THE EXIT WOUNDS:  What if it was the early 70's and Todd was still God, with Brian Wilson looking in?  
KITTY CRAFT: pilfered samples from 60's R&B and 70's schmaltzers with simple beats and understated vocals.  Like 310 for pop dweebs.  
WHITE STRIPES: Thee Headcoats meets Led Zep.  Yes, that's a good mixture!  
ROCK*A*TEENS: Yes, he did reproduce that metallic guitar sound live.  
LOOPER: For a side project, this beat laden sing song spoken word effort is aces.  
GIRLFRIENDO: Took me awhile to get past the screechy dual female vox, but the sense of humour is apparent immediately.  
MY FAVORITE: 1983 new wave returns!  I'm probably the only one waiting.  
AMERICAN ANALOG SET: They haven't unleashed a bad record yet, smooth laid back crisp sweetly touching.  
SHANTI PROJECT: New RHP and Idaho, plus classic Low.  And Hayden.  
JOEL RL PHELPS: not as compelling as the last two, but it'll go down better for the rock fans.  
FLIN FLON: Robinson takes on old school Cure and New Order and unleashes a homage that stands up to the originals.  
RESONARS: Late 60's lo-tek pop like the Move or Kinks, but with American flavor.  An *authentic* retro 60's pop record!  
HAPPYDEADMEN:  Teenage anthems of smooth Swedish pop with a Trash Can Sinatras flavor.  
800 CHERRIES: Boppy Japanese pop that doesn't sound Japanese at all ... it actually has some warmth!  
DRESSY BESSY:  Apples side project with less 60's style but more catchiness.  
BIS: Guilty pleasure of the year, any album with a war cry for putting FUN into music has me on its side.  
SHOWCASE SHOWDOWN: Boston punk with an honest 1977 execution and plenty of sly lyrics.
