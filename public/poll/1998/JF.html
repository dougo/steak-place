OK, so it's more of a DroneOn list than a Chug list ... just that kinda
year (fwiw, I probably listened to last year's Corrupted disc or The
Mike Gunn's _Almaron_ as much as any of these ...)

Neutral Milk Hotel _In the Aeroplane Over the Sea_ CD (Merge)
Body Lovers _Number One of Three_ CD (Atavistic/Young God)
Pelt _For Michael Hannas_ CD (vhf)
Mandible Chatter _Food for the Moon_ CD (Manifold)
Lhasa Cement Plant _I Am Providence_ CD (Flydaddy)
Stone Breath _A Silver Thread to Weave the Seasons_ CD (Camera Obscura)
Kawabata Makoto _Sarangi Solo_ CD (Acid Mothers Temple)
Maurizio Bianchi: _Colori_ CD (Ees't/Alga Marghen)
Korai Öröm: _s/t_ CD *
Chris Watson: _Outside the Circle of Fire_ CD (Touch)

Can't figure out what the name of the (Hungarian) label is from the
sleeve ... distributor is Stereo; this is a late 97 release but it
didn't get into this country till well into 98 (&amp; somehow I doubt it
made anybody's list last year ;-) ...)
