Here 'tis. I don't recall what the rule is re: reissues (in ref. to The
Get It!); include it seprately if you od it like that. 

Sleep: Jerusalem (Music Cartel and "semi-authorized reissue")
Swans: Swans are Dead (Atavistic)
The Get-it!: Raw Funk of '67-'69 (Get)
Queens of the Stone Age (Loosegroove)
Nebula: Let It Burn (Tee Pee)
Trans Am: The Surveillance (Thrill Jockey)
Cap'N Jazz: Analphabetapolothology (Jade Tree)
The Ex: Starters and Alternators (Touch & Go)
Don Caballero: What Burns Never Returns (Touch & Go)

also, I dunno if I'm on shaky ethical ground by including Don Cab, but
it was on my Village Voice ballot which i filled out way before any of
this went down  (honest, just look at their web site.)
