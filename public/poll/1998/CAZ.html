My favorite CDs of 1998.

1. Gastr del Sol              Camofleur (Drag City)
The prettiest, most cohesive, and unfortunately final Gastr album.  The
Grubbs album has some fine picking a la John Fahey. 
2. Karl Hendricks Trio        Declare Your Weapons (Merge)
The only released evidence of the KH/Caulen Kress/Noah Leger trio is as
aggresive and assured as anything Karl's done.  The best rock record of
the year.
3. Sue Garner                 To Run More Smoothly (Thrill Jockey)
Less intricate than Run On, gorgeous vocals, and an old Shams song
(Continuous Play) redone to great effect.
4. Joel RL Phelps             Downer Trio/3 (PacifiCo)
Spare, sutle work edging towards country music (as does his "Spokane
Motel Blues" cover found on the Tom T. Hall Tribute just out on Delmore.
5. Paul Kelly                 Words and Music (Vanguard)
Possibly the finest living songwriter delivers his best record since Comedy.
6. Spinanes                   Arches and Aisles (Sub Pop)
Includes "Reach v. Speed", a duet with Sam Prekop that was my favorite
song this year.
7. Richard Buckner            Since (MCA)
Louder and poppier than Devotion + Doubt, my favorite record of 1997. 
That this is #7 indicates what a good year 1998 was.
8. Mark Eitzel                Caught In a Trap and I Can't Back Out
                              'Cause I Love You Too Much Baby (Matador)
The tracks with Kid Congo Powers, James McNew &amp; Steve Shelley are as
good as anything Eitzel's put out since Everclear.
9. Alejandro Escovedo         More Miles Than Money (Bloodshot)
The best songs of AE's solo career recorded live with strings.  The
final medley incorporating Lou Reed's "Street Hassle" is amazing.
10. Victor Krummenacher       Saint John's Mercy (Magnetic)
The finest post-Camper Van Beethoven record to date features fine
contributions from Bruce Kaphan, Greg Lisher and Chris Xefos.  Available
at http://www.sirius.com/~magnetic/ as is Allison Faith Levy's fine Fog
Show.
11. Robert Wyatt              Shleep (Thirsty Ear)
Thirsty Ear's done a fine job of reissuing Wyatt's solo catalog.  This
record -- released in England in 1997 -- has a jazzier feel than most of
his recent output.  Evan Parker, Hugh Hopper, Brian Eno, Phil Manzanera
and Paul Weller help out.
12. James McMurtry            Walk Between the Raindrops (Sugar Hill)
Outstanding writing, good guitar.  
13. Jack Logan &amp; Bob Kimbell  Little Private Angel (Parasol)
Perfect pop miniatures.
14. Pere Ubu                  Pennsylvania (Tim/Kerr)
Tom Herman's guitar helps make this the best David Thomas recording
since Monster Walks the Winter Lake.
15. Pine Valley Cosmonauts    Salute the Majesty of Bob Wills (Bloodshot)
Fun, enthusiastic tribute to the king of western swing featuring vocals
by Robbie Fulks, Brett Sparks, the Meat Purveyors, Edith Frost, and many
more.
16. Pinetop Seven	            No Breath in the Bellows (Truckstop) and  
              
                              Rigging the Toplights (Truckstop)
Gorgeous, cinematic americana.
17. Clodhopper	               Red's Recovery Room (My Little Planet)
A collection of excellent Danny Pearson songs with clawhammer banjo the
dominant instrument.
18. Jenny Mae	                Don't Wait Up For Me (Anyway)
The finest Burt Bacharach-inspired album of the year.
19. Jim Roll	                 Ready to Hang (One Man Clapping)
Excellent acoustic singer/songwriter fare from Michigan.
20. Various Artists           San Francisco Song Cycle Vol.1 (Olde West)
These 2 discs compile performances by over two dozen songwriters,
including Sonya Hunter, Carmaig de Forest, Sally Timms, Chuck Prophet
and Victor Krummenacher.  All of it is good, some of it's amazing.
