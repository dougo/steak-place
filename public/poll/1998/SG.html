Doug,

Steve Green, although no longer a Chug member, wanted me to submit a list
for him a few weeks back.  I'm sure it's not in the format you were
requesting, but when have you known Steve Green to follow the rules?
By all means, edit as you see fit.  If you choose not to accept this list,
no hard feelings (from me, at least).  If you have questions/concerns, feel
free to email Steve at fightdoc-NOSPAM@getnet.com.

Regards,

Oliver W. Porter

heya ollie, couldja do mew a favor?  send this to the chug guy who
collects "best of the year lists"...  i actually can make one.  as
follows:

1.  Bassholes- _When My Blue Moon Turns Red Again_ Dbl. LP (In The Red) So
far above everything done lately it's beneath comment.  Hotshit drummer.
Jon Fine would pretend to like it.

2.  King Bros- S/T LP (Bulb)  Basically Mudhoney AND Guitar Wolf done
RIGHT.  Noise is for heroes, leave the music for zeroes...  or Doug
Mosurak.

3.  Lightning-Beat Man- _Apartment Wrestling ROck and Roll Girl_ (Voodoo
RHythms)  (In Beavis voice)  ...he's uh swiss...  

4.  The Leaving Trains LIVE at the "desert trash blast".  Falling James
was always a punchline to me, but for a brief window in the fall of '98 he
made as much sense as the Urinals or the Electric Eels or the Archies
or the Sun City Girls...
I'm sure I won't feel the same the next time around, but for a short while
I didn't hate musicians.  The 10-minute "Murdered" put this one over the
fence...

5.  Vanilla Ice- Live- TONIGHT.  Just got back.  So retarded on so many
levels.  Words cannot express.  But then again, I have a documented IQ of
173 and most folks don't.  The Rage Against Ice mix of "Ice Ice Baby"...
BIZZZZ-AMMM !!!!  Why Everlast can get critical credibility why this GOD
is regularly mocked just shows why everyone sucks and there's bound to be
17 Hitlers in our near future.  Let's just trust me, kill Thurston Moore
and all the Beastie Boys and call it even.

Everything else in the last 27 months sucked, however.

(For a footnoted excursus into the reasoning behind said judgements, send
$13 + $2.95 p&amp;h to me c/o The Burundi Justice Front, PO BOX go eat me,
Barcelona, Spain.)

gracias, sugarcock,
-Esteban Pablo Verde
