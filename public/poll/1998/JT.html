Don't Call It A Comeback... Well, All right, Call It A Comeback:  Jon Easdale
(the singer/songwriter from Dramarama) was the nicest surprise of the year, a
terrific CD full of biting, sardonic tunes with hooks aplenty.  Also in the
comeback department was the new CD from Joe King and the reconstituted Queers;
fresh out of rehab, with a new label and band, Joe used his battle with drugs
and alcohol as the inspiration for clever, catchy, funny  punk tunes, and they
were the most entertaining live band I saw all year (caught them five times in
'98, on both coasts!)   

Has Beens:  R.E.M.,  Pearl Jam, Sonic Youth.

Best Boy Band:  Backstreet Boys.  Runner Up:  Hanson

Quick! Name any two members of any of these multi-platinum acts:   Matchbox
20, Fastball, Marcy Playground, Third Eye Blind, Savage Garden, Creed

Most Annoying Novelty Act:  Barenaked Ladies   Runner Up: Marilyn Manson

Proof The World Will (&amp; Should) End At The Millennium:   Celine Dion;  'N
Sync;   the "Swing" revival;   MTV castoffs  Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller
become major motion picture stars;
