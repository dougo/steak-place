Hi Doug --

Basically, this is a list of all the records that came out in 1998 that I
bought.  Otherwise I was too busy tracking down old favorites and
recommendations and enjoying various Miles Davis and Tropicalia reissues,
as well as the great Nuggets box, to invest the time &amp; money buying new
music.  So, in no particular order:

Shellac, _Terraform_ LP (Touch &amp; Go)
Caustic Resin, _The Medicine is All Gone_ CD (Alias)
Mark Hollis, _Mark Hollis_ CD (Polydor UK)
Saint Etienne, _Good Humor_ CD (Sub Pop)
Mark Eitzel, _Caught in a Trap and I Can't Back Out 'cause I Love You Too
Much, Baby_ CD (Matador)
Bedhead, _Transaction de Novo_ CD (Trance Syndicate)
Silkworm, _Blueblood_ CD (Touch &amp; Go)
Robert Wyatt, _Shleep_ CD (Thirsty Ear)
Neil Hamburger, _Raw Hamburger_ (Drag City)
Modest Mouse, "Other People's Lives" 7" (Up)

Steve
