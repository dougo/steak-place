Doug,

	Thanks for doing this once again and sorry it's so late.

Gently down the mainstream...

Twenty faves of '98:

1. Silver Jews _American Water_ CD (Drag City)
2. Billy Bragg and Wilco _Mermaid Avenue_ CD (Elektra)
3. Belle and Sebastian _The Boy With The Arab Strap_ CD (Matador)
4. Bob Dylan _Live 1966: The "Royal Albert Hall" Concert_ CD (Columbia)
5. Lucinda Williams _Car Wheels On A Gravel Road_ CD (Mercury)
6. The Renderers _A Dream Of The Sea_ CD (Siltbreeze)
7. Neutral Milk Hotel _In the Aeroplane Over The Sea_ CD (Merge)
8. Quasi _Featuring "Birds"_ CD (Up)
9. Clem Snide _You Were A Diamond_ CD (Tractor Beam)
10. R.E.M. _Up_ CD (Warner Bros.)
11. Golden Smog _Weird Tales_ CD (Rykodisc)
12. Sonic Youth _A Thousand Leaves_ CD (DGC)

16. Various Artists _Lemonlime Vol. 2...A Pop Compilation_ CD (Spin Art)
17. The Fleshtones _More Than Skin Deep_ LP (TelStar)
18. Jad Fair and Yo La Tengo _Strange But True_ CD (Matador)
19. Silkworm _Blueblood_ CD (Touch and Go)
20. Tuscadero _My Way Or The Highway_ CD (Teen Beat/Elektra)


Like background singers, they all come in threes...

Bubbling under: Jonathan Richman, Dan Bern, Pee Shy
I thought about buying them, but every time I thought about them, they
weren't where I was looking for them: Archers of Loaf, His Name Is Alive,
Fatboy Slim
Should've been on my '97 list, but I didn't hear them until '98: Modest
Mouse, Tobin Sprout, Gothic Archies
