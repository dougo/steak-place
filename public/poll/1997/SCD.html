Alright you pollster bastard, here are my favorites of the past year:

* Built to Spill, _Perfect From Now On_
* Jonathan Fire*Eater, _Wolf Songs for Lambs_
* The Promise Ring, _Nothing Feels Good_
* Low, _The Curtain Hits the Cast_ (not sure if this was '96 or even 95)
* Better Off Airport, _VIVRE_
* V/A, _We Will Fall: The Iggy Pop Tribute_
* V/A, _Heroes of Country Music, Vol. 2: Legends of Honky Tonk_
* Mick Harvey, _Pink Elephants_
* Utah Phillips/Ani DiFranco _The Past Didn't Go Anywhere_

That's all I can think of now.  Will send more if I can think of 'em.
