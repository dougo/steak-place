dougo,

I'll stick to a top-13, restricting myself to records
I actually bought/got last year....

- Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds = The boatman's call (Mute)
- Eleventh Dream Day = Eighth (City Slang / Thrill Jockey)
- The Boxhead Ensemble = Dutch Harbor: where the sea breaks its back
(Atavistic)
- Yo La Tengo = I can hear the heart beating as one (Matador)
- Palace = Lost blues and other songs (Drag City / Domino)
- Smog = Red Apple Falls (Drag City / Domino)
- Edith Frost = Calling over time (Drag City / Domino)
- Belle and Sebastian = If you're feeling sinister (Jeepster / Virgin)
- Mike Watt = Contemplating the engine room (Columbia)
- Jim O'Rourke = Bad timing (Drag City)
- John Zorn/Masada = Het (Avant)
- Buena Vista Social Club (World Circuit / Nonesuch)
- John Coltrane = The complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings (Impulse!)


and would like to add 7 records (not to be counted though)
I guess I would have liked to hear but didn't manage to 
(all clues to (not) do so are welcome):

Aerial M / Shipping News / Mogwai / Tindersticks / Lambchop / Arto Lindsay
/ Cyro Baptista

bye
