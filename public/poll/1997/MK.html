VA: BEG SCREAM &amp; SHOUT-THE OL' BOX OF '60'S SOUL (RHINO RECORDS 6xCD) what
can I say this is the beginning and end of your primer into great soul
singles.  Yes, there are some tracks that are missing but you can't ask for
everything. 

DELGADOS: BBC SESSIONS (STRANGE FRUIT RECORDS CD UK) the only thing that
could have made this release better would have been the inclusion of the
Delgados third Peel Session...I can't wait to include their second album on
next year's end of year poll.

BELLE &amp; SABASTIAN: IF YOU'RE FEELING SINISTER (THE ENCLAVE CD)

JOHN COLTRANE: THE COMPLETE 1961 VILLAGE VANGUARD RECORDINGS (IMPULSE RECORDS
4xCD)  Coltrane and Dolphy trading licks on the melting ice cream cone of
post-bop jazz.  

EVELYN FOREVER: NIGHTCLUB JITTERS (AIRPLAY RECORDS CD)  Young boys from New
Brunswick playing guitars and dreaming of one day growing up to be the
Replacements.

KING CRIMSON: EPITAPH (DISCIPLINE GLOBAL MOBILE 2xCD)  Prog Rock /
Proto-Metal / Goth Rock who cares back in the late sixties Fripp and Co. kick
some serious ass on the live stage.

HONEYRIDER: ALL SYSTEMS GO! (DAMAGED GOODS RECORDS CD UK)  this is a San
Diego based group on a British label playing music like erly Jesus &amp; Mary
Chain but with a smile.

ADVENTURES IN STEREO: ADVENTURES IN STEREO-THE BLUE ALBUM (CREEPING BENT
RECORDS CD UK)  lovely

CHARLES MINGUS: PASSIONS OF A MAN-CHARLES MINGUS THE COMPLETE ATLANTIC
RECORDINGS 1956-1961 (RHINO RECORDS 6xCD)  I don't even know where to begin
with saying how wonderful this is.  The best damn jazz bassist and one of the
greatest jazz composers ever.

HELEN LOVE: DOES YOUR HEART GO BOOM EP (CHE RECORDS CD5 UK)  Does My Heart Go
Boom?  Yes it does when I listen to this music from Joey Ramones favorite
Welsh lass.

PROMISE RING: THE HORSE LATITUDES (JADE TREE RECORDS CD) Squirrelbaite.

MERRYMAKERS: BUBBLEGUN (TOSHIBA-VIRGIN RECORDS CD JAPAN) Power Pop from
Sweden that only the Japanese appreciate.

VA: DIAL M FOR MERTHYR-RECORD HIR CYMRAEG GORAU YN Y BYD ERIOED...MWY NA
THEBYG (FIERCE PANDA RECORDS 2xLP UK)  a double lp of Welsh pop for now
people!

AUTUMN LEAVES: TREATS AND TREASURES (GRIMSEY RECORDS CD)  12 strings and pop
songs can only mean that it sounds like The Byrds.

NUTHINS: ONE STEP FORWARD (TWIST RECORDS LP UK)  Garage rockin' fun England.

ANDY STATMAN QUARTET: BETWEEN HAVEN &amp; EARTH-MUSIC OF THE JEWISH MYSTICS
(SHANACHIE RECORDS CD)  My roots music.

LEE 'SCRATCH' PERRY: ARKOLOGY (ISLAND-JAMAICA RECORDS 3xCD)  The music is
great my only problem with the package is that I would have put all of the
dub plates on a different disc from the actual songs.

DERRERO: DERRERO (BIG NOISE RECORDINGS CD UK)  More Welsh pop that brings to
mind early Senseless Things and Mega City Four. 

TWA TOOTS: DON'T SEND ME FLOWERS-A COMPILATION (ACCIDENT RECORDS LP UK)  One
of the great lost bands from the early to mid-eighties...a Peel Fave Rave way
back when.

LEE DORSEY: WHEELIN' AND DEALIN'-THE DEFINITIVE COLLECTION (ARISTA RECORDS
CD)  Can you believe it, a top twenty release on Arista Records...then again
the tracks were recorded thirty years ago.
