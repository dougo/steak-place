Doug:

all LP/CD, unless otherwise noted

1. Sleep: Jerusalem (London/Polygram)
2. Stooges: Raw Power (Elektra) [regardless of the rule about reissues,
I'd argue that the remix makes this a radically different record than
the orig.]
3. Trans Am: Surrender to the Night
4. C4AM95: III (dunno the label offhand and I just moved so's my CDs are
still in boxes)
5. Fu Manchu: The Action Is Go (Mammoth)
6. Corrupted: Paso Inferior (see C$AM95 for label info)
7. Dianogah: As Seen From Above (Ohio Gold?)
8. Karp: Self Titled LP (K)
9. Major Stars: Whatever The Fuck Kate And Wayne Called It one sided LP
(Twisted Village)
10. Sonic Youth (whatever the name of the red instrumental one is)
11. Zeni Geva: Nai-Ha (Skin Graft)
12. Frogs: Starjob
13. Built to Spill: Perfect from Now On (WB? Elektra?)
14. Atari Teenage Riot: the one on Grand Royal

live: Golden, the Ex, Fu Manchu, Sonic Youth, Penderecki conducting the
New York Philharmonic, Trans Am, Storm and Stress, Don Caballero

apologies in advance to whoever I left out, and there's probably quite a
few.
