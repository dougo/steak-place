hi doug and all,

here are my favorite 20 albums/singles for 1997 - - - -&gt;
(in no particular order)

(1) adventures in stereo "adventures in stereo (blue cover)" (creeping
bent) :: most interesting use of tape loops mostly from older records.
rounds a '60s girl group collection.

(2) diskothi-q "waterworld" (shrimper) :: made my march this year.  rock
on!!

(3) john davis "blue mountain" (shrimper) 

(4) sukapatch "smokin' grass and haulin' ass" (slabco) :: they should have
been more popular than land of loops.

(5) nothing painted blue "emotional discipline" (scat) :: all the great npb
songs that i always heard on other people's mix tapes but never had a copy
of my own!

(6) teenage fan club "songs from northern britian" (major label) :: it
sounds like the birds  but it still makes me swoon.

(7) ropers "world is fire" (teenbeat) 

(8) elliot smith "either/or" (kill rock stars) :: a major winner after the
first krs record.

(9) holiday "cafe reggio" (spinart)

(10) belle &amp; sebastian "if you're feeling sinister" (major label)

(11) high llamas "hawaii" (v2?) :: yes, this qualifies. this is the
domestic release with the additional ep disk.

(12) mountain goats "full force galesburg" (emperor jones) 

(13)  poundsign "michigan" 7" (belmondo discs)

(14) future bible hereos "memories of love" (slow river) :: i originally
trashed this but i came to love this.

(15) various "bossa novaville" (capitol) :: this volume of the ultra-lounge
series is just super swank!!!

(16) various "pop jingu" (sonorama) :: brilliant japanese pop music.

(17) le mans "un rayo de sol" 7" (grimsey)

(18) ninotchka "i've got wings" 7" (grimsey)

(19) various "pop american style" (march)

(20) john william "star wars soundtrack" (major label) :: yes this
qualifies. this is the first time the soundtrack was sequenced in the order
of the movie!

super honorable mentions that didn't qualify for the favorite 20::

(1) beach boys "wild honey" (capitol) - - just a great record. so solid.

(2) felt "train above the city" (creation) - - super mellow musac (sp?).
found this in the cheapie on a really horrible blind date.

(3) slowdive "just for a day" (creation) - - reminds me of meeting my now
ex-boyfriend. sentimental.

1998 wishes::

- - belle and sebastian singles compliation. i've failed at hunting down my
favorite singles and would love this since most singles cost around $5-$10
each.
