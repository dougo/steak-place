 I feel quite a bit better about this year than I have about the last 
 couple.  For the first time in quite a while, I've had to work to cut 
 down.
     
 I find I have very little patience for anything "experimental" this 
 year (I hope this isn't a sign of incipient old-fartdom), and I didn't 
 find any electronica of interest (granted, I didn't look very 
 hard--but nothing stood out like *Entroducing...* or *Songs of a Dead 
 Dreamer* did last year.  Further, I didn't find much new hard rock of 
 interest (the Great Unravelling and Satisfact didn't quite make the 
 cut).  I find this last very disturbing--I am NOT looking forward to 
 the ever more inevitable Twisted Sister revival.
     
 Props to Masaki Batoh's *Collected Works 1995-1996*, and Syrup USA's 
 *All Over the Land* for having several terrific songs apiece, but not 
 maintaining best-of-year quality over the whole album.  Props also to
 Some Velvet Sidewalk who *still* haven't made a great album, but came
 quite a bit closer with *generate!*.
     
 Props also to the Marbles, for making the sort of really nice, 
 friendly relaxing album that it wouldn't occur to me to put on a 
 best-of-year list.  If *Fun Trick Noisemaker* is *Today!*, and *Tone 
 Soul Evolution* is *Pet Sounds* (or vice versa?), then *"Pyramid 
 Landing" &amp; Other Favorites* is *Wild Honey*.  (Which would make 
 *Science Faire* *Best of Volume I*, or maybe *Endless Summer* (and 
 this whole analogy REALLY stupid...)).



 Anyway, on with the list...
