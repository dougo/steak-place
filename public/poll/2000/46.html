<hr><h1>Kathy Fennessy's Chugchanga-L Poll 2000 Entry</h1>

This is a pretty "safe" list (i.e. nothing particularly edgy), but it's also<br>
a pretty accurate snapshot of the 2000 releases/re-releases I enjoyed the<br>
most, so here goes:<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#badly">1. Badly Drawn Boy - The Hour of Bewilderbeast (Beggar's Banquet)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#air_virgin">2. Air - Virgin Suicides S/T (Astralwerks)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#air_premiers">3. Air - Premiers Symptomes (Astralwerks) (1999)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#new">4. The New Pornographers - Mass Romantic (Mint)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#king">5. King Biscuit Time - No Style EP (Astralwerks)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#cash">6. Johnny Cash - American III: Solitary Man (Columbia)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#various_o_bro">7. Various Artists - Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? Soundtrack (Mercury)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#radiohead">8. Radiohead - Kid A (Capitol)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#yo">9. Yo La Tengo - And Then Nothing Turned Itself... (Matador)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#cat_stevens">10. Cat Stevens - Teaser &amp; The Firecat Reissue (A&amp;M)</a><br>
<br>
I was particularly disappointed by the new releases from Belle &amp; Sebastian &amp;<br>
PJ Harvey.  Sleater-Kinney just missed my list, but I swear they're starting<br>
to grown on me...<br>
<br>
The releases I listened to the most aren't listed above as they were two of<br>
my favorites for 1999, &amp; I haven't grown tired of them yet: The Beta Band's<br>
Three E.P.'s and Belle &amp; Sebastian's Tigermilk.  Great music for lazy Sunday<br>
afternoons.  Nothing released in 2000 hooked me quite the same way, but the<br>
CDs on my list each contain at least one track I enjoy that much (and in the<br>
same way).  <br>
