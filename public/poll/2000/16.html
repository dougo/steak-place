<br>
Disappointments of the year:<br>
1. Jayhawks - Smile (American/Sony)<br>
This was the most brutal ugliness imaginable. Take half-finished songs, <br>
polish to Pink Floyd-like sonic perfection, and then try to pass it off<br>
as "our masterwork". Urgh.<br>
<br>
2. Ruben Gonzalez - Chanchullo (Nonesuch)<br>
If I have to hear his piano waterfall sound effect one more time, I'll<br>
probably strangle someone. Sure, he's a zillion years old and you can't<br>
teach an old dog new tricks, but there were only three ideas on this whole<br>
album.<br>
<br>
3. Radiohead - Kid A (Parlophone/EMI)<br>
Too much hype, and not enought follow-through. Sure, it's a good album,<br>
but there were so many other albums that were better.<br>
<br>
4. Godspeed Yo Black Emperor - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to<br>
Heaven (Kranky)<br>
It still deserves a place near the top of the Top 20, but it was really<br>
too much of a good thing, stretched out too thin. Would have made a killer<br>
single CD. At 2CDs, it doesn't fly quite so high.<br>
<br>
5. The Cure - Bloodflowers (Elektra)<br>
Say goodbye, kiddies, for real this time. Better than Wild Mood Swings, but<br>
ultimately it left a pretty bitter taste in the mouth. The concert was a<br>
highlight of the year. This was just bland and only semi-memorable.<br>
