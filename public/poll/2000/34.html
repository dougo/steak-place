I was broke for most of the year, so there are still many records I<br>
haven't heard that would probably make my list, like the newest ones<br>
from the White Stripes and Vagtazo Halottkemek.<br>
I'll only comment on the records from my home country cos I don't think<br>
too many chugsters are familiar with them.<br>
Finnish marginalia had a great year: lots of great records &amp; gigs. 2000<br>
was the kind of year we haven't experienced since the glory days of Bad<br>
Vugum. What we're still lacking in Finland is bands who are more<br>
influenced by Essential Logic or the Stretchheads than by Tortoise or<br>
Sonic Youth.<br>
<br>
Mental Market, Spooky (Popatak)<br>
- Explosive &amp; tuneful wall-of-guitar, killer choruses and madness-fueled<br>
lyrics that would make Roky Erickson happy. They list Hawkwind &amp; The<br>
Bevis Frond as their influences. Surprisingly, this was the highlight of<br>
the year for me. http://www.mentalmarket.com/<br>
<br>
Radiopuhelimet, Oulu On Kaupungin Nimi (Bad Vugum)<br>
- After a very disappointing album ("Hiljaista!") they made this, one of<br>
their best. They've never sounded so relaxed yet tight in a (I guess)<br>
carduccian sense of the word. Love 'em to death.<br>
http://www.lpg.fi/badvugum/<br>
<br>
Office Building, To See Only Shadows (Fonal)<br>
- Led by Janne Laurila, a noise-kid who somehow metamorphosed into a<br>
very talented songwriter with a shockingly beautiful singing voice.<br>
Their debut album is full of folky, melancholic &amp; timeless songs. The<br>
solo gig I saw in late 1999 was one of the most moving experiences I've<br>
ever witnessed, music or otherwise. Teemu Elo of Circle is the guitarist<br>
in Office Building. http://www.fonal.com/ (seemed to be down)<br>
<br>
Eturivi, Lempilapset 7" (Verdura)<br>
- A project that's more or less a continuation of the Kirvasto project.<br>
This has Kake Puhuu (AKA Keuhkot) ranting plus members of Circle &amp;<br>
Ektroverde providing the electro-pulsing background. I think you have to<br>
be from Finland to fully appreciate what's going on in here. Maybe.<br>
verdura@worldmailer.com<br>
<br>
Platypus, Disco Recorder (Autotehtaat)<br>
- One of the many secret weapons of the Finnish marginalia. On this CDr<br>
they sound a lot like early Chrome with evil alien vocals, lots of weird<br>
effects &amp; kraut-ish rhythm work. They're still delightfully primitive in<br>
their approach. http://www.uta.fi/~pm54740/platypus/<br>
<br>
Festermen, Full Treatment (Bad Afro)<br>
- They're from a small village in the middle of nowhere. Maybe that is<br>
why they're so amazingly brutal. Motörhead colliding w/feedtime?<br>
http://www.vow.dk/badafro/ and for just as good older records check:<br>
http://www.sjoki.uta.fi/~latvis/levy-yhtiot/TrashCanRecords/index.html<br>
<br>
Kemialliset Ystävät, Pieni Palatsi 7" (Vauva)<br>
- Primitive backwoods psych, this is Jan Anderzen's finest &amp; most<br>
together release. For fans of Godz, Mourning Cloak, Amps For Christ &amp;<br>
the most sunburned moments of the Sun City Girls, I guess. Just check<br>
the links page on their web site: http://members.vip.fi/~anderzen/<br>
<br>
Es, A Love Cycle (Fonal)<br>
- A solo project from Sam Zapkilla who runs Fonal Records and plays in<br>
Kiila, Velvolino, Slaughterhouse Quintet and maybe a few others. Loops<br>
made w/record players. Beautiful &amp; spooky. http://www.fonal.com/ (seemed<br>
to be down)<br>
<br>
Mother Goose, Little Richard CD-ep (Seriously Groovy)<br>
- Ridiculously ignored in their home country, Mother Goose had to be<br>
signed to an English label for the second time (the first was Blast<br>
First, remember? Oh, you don't?) to get a record out. It's great,<br>
subdued, emotional (not emo!) guitar-based rock music, and, no, they<br>
don't sound like Sonic Youth anymore.<br>

<br>
That's all. Hope my English isn't too bad.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sorry to bother, but I've recently discovered two records that will<br>
definitely make my 2000 top 20 list. So could you please remove the<br>
Movitone &amp; .fuckingcom records from my list and put these in instead:<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#jackieo">Jackie-O Motherfucker, Fig. 5 (Road Cone)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#six">Six Organs Of Admittance, The Manifestation 12" (Ba Da Bing)</a><br>
<br>
Again, sorry to bother you, but these records are so unbelievably great<br>
that they must be included. Hope you understand. Thanks.<br>
