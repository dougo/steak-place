OK, just to stop myself from dithering (I've been re-jiggering this damn thing
every three days for two weeks now, order may still shift but that doesn't
affect you) ...

$Current 93, _Sleep has his House_ (Durtro)
$Roberts, Dean, _...and the Black Moths play the Grand Cinema_ (Ritornell)
$Tarwater, _Animals, Suns and Atoms_ (Kitty-Yo)
$Sonic Youth, _NYC Ghosts & Flowers_ (Geffen)
$Stangl, Burkhard & Kurzmann, Christof, _Schnee_ (Erstwhile)
$Acid Mothers Temple, _La Novia_ (Eclipse)
$Morricone, Ennio, _Gli Occhi freddi della Paura_ (Dagored)
$Maclure, Pinkie, _From Memorial Crossing_ (Liquid)
$Thuja, _The Deer Lay Down their Bones_ (tUMULt)
$Schmickler, Marcus, _SATOR ROTAS_ (a-musik)
$Shalabi Effect, _s/t_ (Alien8)
$Abunai!, _Round Wound_ (Camera Obscura)
$Lowdown, The, _Revolver 2_ (Thin the Herd)

re the Lowdown: _Revolver 2_ is my best guess at a title ... I expect you'll get
any number of guesses (_Mud Capacitor_ seems about equally likely) ... if you've
seen the cover you know what I mean ...

#Hi Doug.  Here's my list.
#
#Carl
#

$    1. Case, Neko & Her Boyfriends, _Furnace Room Lullaby_ (Bloodshot)
A big, beautiful voice with fine material, fine backing, fine production
and easily my favorite record released this year.
$    2. Giant Sand, _Chore of Enchantment_ (Thrill Jockey)
The best record Howe Gelb's ever made balances the loose improv vibe of
the band with disciplined production and great songs.  V2 deserves
credit for financing this and grief for dropping them. 
$    3. Yo La Tengo, _And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out_ (Matador)
A textured, clear-eyed look at a relationship, and another distinctly
great YLT record.
$    4. Phelps, Joel R.L.  & the Downer Trio, _Inland Empires_ EP (Moneyshot)
An incredibly sad but beautiful (and largely acoustic) record consisting
of Phelps's superb interpretations of songs by the Go-Betweens, Iris
DeMent, Townes Van Zandt and Steve Earle bookending his original "Now
You Are Found".
$    5. Eleventh Dream Day, _Stalled Parade_ (Thrill Jockey)
Their most aggressive record since _El Moodio_ and a must for lovers of
Crazy Horse guitar workouts.
$    6. Pinetop Seven, _Bringing Home the Last Great Strike_ (Truckstop)
Another lush, cinematic record from Darren Richard and a cast of thousands.
$    7. Naked Omaha, _Belt_ (self-released)
Terrific alt.country drawing from the same elements present in the first
two Uncle Tupelo albums.
$    8. Mekons, _Journey To the End of the Night_ (Quarterstick)
My favorite Mekons' record since _Curse_. 
$    9. Silkworm, _Lifestyle_ (Touch & Go)
More great stripped-down rock from one of America's best rock bands.
$    10. Warren Zevon, _Life'll Kill Ya_ (Artemis)
One record every five years is not enough, especially since Zevon's
preoccupation with infirmity and mortality makes it sound as if he's
living on borrowed time.
$    11. Various Artists, _Come On Beautiful: A Tribute to American Music
Club_ (Big Night)
A coherent and highly successful collection of AMC covers by Steve Wynn,
Paula Frazer, Calexico, Ida, the Willard Grant Conspiracy and likeminded
artists.
$    12. Waco Brothers, _Electric Waco Chair_ (Bloodshot)
Waco records make me happy.  This is my favorite since _Cowboy in Flames_.
$    13. Drive-By Truckers, _Alabama Ass-Whuppin'_ (Second Heaven)
Southern-fired rock recorded live in concert featuring two gifted
songwriters in Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley.  Hood¹s introductions
(especially for  "18 Wheels of Love") are worth the price of the album.
$    14. Willard Grant Conspiracy, _Mojave_ (Slow River)
The strongest WGC album yet.
$    15. Hogan, Kelly & the Pine Valley Cosmonauts, _Beneath the Country
Underdog_ (Bloodshot)
Hogan's gift for interpretation is ably demonstrated by covers of "Papa
Was a Rodeo", "Whispering Pines" and pretty much every track on this
fine album.  
$    16. Dirtball, _Turn Up the Barn_ (Planetary)
Dirtball go out on a high note with more of Wes Freed's typically
soulful singing.
$    17. Boxstep, _Boxstep_ (self-released)
A new band out of Pittsburgh that sounds like an indie-rock (and vocal)
take on the Dirty Three.  Scratchy from the Deliberate Strangers fiddles
all over this record.
$    18. Sea and Cake, The, _Oui_ (Thrill Jockey)
My favorite of theirs since _Nassau_. 
$    19. Roll, Jim _Lunette_ (New West)
Another strong set of songs by Roll, produced by Walter Salas-Humara. 
$    20. Prophet, Chuck _The Hurting Business_ (Hightone) 
Prophet mixes beats into his Americana with excellent results,
especially on "Dyin' All Young".

BEST VIDEO: 
Damn! I forgot to watch Much Music this year! 

WORST ALBUM: 
Christ, how can you narrow that down? I mean, how many hundreds of thousands

of full-length CDs are released annually? I can list off dozens of 
disappointments by other wise solid artists. "Art Official Intelligence" by 
De La Soul springs immediately to mind. As does "Gung Ho", Patti Smith's 
2000 release. Not terrible albums by any stretch of the imagination, but 
nowhere near up to par. Oh yeah, the whole Confrontation Camp debacle (Chuck

D, Professor Griff, and Kyle Ice Jason) makes it clear that Mistachuck 
should keep up the political punditry, but bow out of hiphop before it's too

late. 

WORST SINGLE: 
Again, relative isolation from commercial radio means I lack the ability to 
pick Top 40 tracks outta the air. Five months after moving to the densest 
radio market in North America and I can't tell a Creed from a Matchbox. 
Colour me a cultural ‘tard. 

Can't Believe The Hype! (The most over-exposed and over-inflated of  2000) 
1. Eminem (I mean, really! I've oft wondered exactly what it'd take for me 
to long for the return of Vanilla Ice.) 
2. Elian Gonzalez. Sure, I was as charmed as the next jaded hack by Elian's 
heartwarming rendition of Split Enz's "Six Months In A Leaky Boat", but as 
the summer wound down and the news broke that Gonzales was in fact the 
Bacharach-wannabe self-styled pop genius with a preponderance for animal 
imagery who penned the Hampsterdance (sic) track and a club anthem ‘bout 
letting canines out, I'd had enough. The cameo in a Budweiser "Whassup!" 
commercial shot on location from his uncle's front porch was the final nail.


Most Likely To Succeed In 2001 
1. Hawksley Workman (c'mon, this fella shoulda been topping charts two years

ago...what's the delay?). Andy Stochansky too, come to think of it. Picture 
a band featuring the two of ‘em. Now picture said band on stage at Wembley 
Stadium. Now picture Workman holding down Noel Gallagher whilst Stochansky 
applies bunsen burner-heated needlenose pliers to Oasis member's nipples. A 
simple thought to warm you through the long winter months ahead. 

2. Maximum R N B. With powerhouse promotions man Keith Maruk (Epitaph 
Canada) at the helm the band can't help but break large, whether or not they

ever learn a chord. As an added bonus, they apparently have sev'ral chords 
under their belts, way more than the average rock n' roll band needs. 

OK now SOUND OFF! (Commentary is crucial!) 
Beginning in 2001, I, Russell Gragg and !Earshot Magazine will collectively 
launch a boycott of all musical artists with numbers in their monikers. 
Though we're uncertain as to whether this is simply a new band-naming trend 
a la the "one-syllable-word" feeding frenzy of the 
late-eighties/early-nineties, or whether this is, in fact, proof positive 
that all good band names have been taken. 

Either way, you've been warned FingerEleven, Sum41, Matchbox20, 3 Doors 
Down, Blink 182, Eve6, and don't even think about reuniting, Level 42.

#doug
#
here's what i sent to pazz and jop poll in village voice
#
#see you
#
#tim
-------------------------
Maybe I'm getting old--well, OK, I'm _definitely_ getting old--but for
whatever reason, little of the modern music I run across truly moves me.  I
like to think it's a function of not working in a record store anymore and
only having AM in the car as much as anything else.  Then again...all this
bleepy electronic shit.  Kraftwerk may envelop me in coldness, but I put on
one of these computer CDs people send me, and I feel the airy embrace
of...nothing.  What is this music about?  Why does it exist?  Who feels
compelled to make it, record it, put it out, listen to it?  Is it still
popular?  Was it ever?  I think people just buy the t-shirts.  I feel like
my dad must have felt when he'd hear Minutemen and Husker Du records
wafting from my bedroom.  

Anyway, here are seven LPs that meant a lot to me in the last year, in the
order that they occurred to me:

$Goatsnake, _I_ (Man's Ruin, 1999)  
$Nina Nastasia, _Dogs_ (Socialist)
$Shellac, _1000 Hurts_ (Touch and Go)
$Cobra Verde, _Nightlife_ (Motel, 1999)
$Joel R.L. Phelps, _Blackbird_ (Pacifico, 1999)
$Outkast, _Stankonia_ (Arista)
$Silkworm, _Lifestyle_ (Touch and Go)

12 each, with extra point as the angels' share.

Goatsnake is a cache of dudes from Los Angeles.  Their music has weight and
impact.  The weight is moved and the impact is made with rapidity and grace
and a lack of the “endearing” slop that handicaps most average rock music.
Goatsnake's commitment to being a great and truly hard rock band must be
admired, for it is a commitment that few are able or willing to make.  _I_
crushes its would-be competition and renders laughable the tags of lazy
critics ("stoner rock" chief among them).  Haven't had a chance to absorb
2000's _Flower of Disease_ yet.

Nina Nastasia is a winning musician from Manhattan.  Her debut is one of
five discrete albums she has already written.  The marvelous, transparent
arrangements on _Dogs_ are unalterably wed to the songs, and the songs
themselves are so guileless and open that I want to talk back to them.
Don't do that.  Why are you staying with that creep?  In addition to being
a dope fiend, he isn't very nice.  Sit up straight.  Stop playing with your
hair.  Everyone has to die some day.  That was a beautiful song, just the
right length.  You know, you have a very nice voice.

Three guys in Shellac.  Each of them is indispensable.  I have read a lot
of catty reviews of _1000 Hurts_, and all of them share a reluctance to
discuss the music that results when the album is put on a functioning
stereo system and played through speakers.  Said music is usually brutal,
occasionally touching, often real funny, and worth playing a lot.

Cobra Verde are bent on returning some kind of glam whatzis to rock, as if
it ever left, but aesthetic concerns don't overwhelm all the great songs on
_Nightlife_, easily the band's finest record to date.

On _Blackbird_, Joel R.L. Phelps puts his powerful voice on cruise control,
where it has always been most effective, and the Downer Trio largely
forsakes its draggy tendencies as it knocks out nine songs as good as
anything JRLP has written in his long tenure in rock.  Throw in a stunning
version of the Comsat Angels' "Lost Continent," and you have a flatly great
album, probably the best record on which Joel has ever been.   


Outkast's _Stankonia_ is a hip-hop record to be loved as well as admired.
Its clear-eyed dissections of birth outta wedlock, unabashed love of "hos,"
and the disenfranchisement of black America (among other things) are witty
and learned, and the (actually played) music is egalitarian funk that
fondly recalls Sly and the Family Stone rather than sampling them.  I like
its brains, I like its ass, I like its heart, and the double vinyl is
cheaper than the CD.  

I'm voting for my own record because I've listened to it a hell of a lot,
and I love it.  I know it's unseemly.

25. Man...or Astroman? - A Spectrum of Infinite Scale (Touch&Go)
26. Blonde Redhead - Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons (Touch&Go)


Disappointments of the year:
1. Jayhawks - Smile (American/Sony)
This was the most brutal ugliness imaginable. Take half-finished songs, 
polish to Pink Floyd-like sonic perfection, and then try to pass it off
as "our masterwork". Urgh.

2. Ruben Gonzalez - Chanchullo (Nonesuch)
If I have to hear his piano waterfall sound effect one more time, I'll
probably strangle someone. Sure, he's a zillion years old and you can't
teach an old dog new tricks, but there were only three ideas on this whole
album.

3. Radiohead - Kid A (Parlophone/EMI)
Too much hype, and not enought follow-through. Sure, it's a good album,
but there were so many other albums that were better.

4. Godspeed Yo Black Emperor - Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to
Heaven (Kranky)
It still deserves a place near the top of the Top 20, but it was really
too much of a good thing, stretched out too thin. Would have made a killer
single CD. At 2CDs, it doesn't fly quite so high.

5. The Cure - Bloodflowers (Elektra)
Say goodbye, kiddies, for real this time. Better than Wild Mood Swings, but
ultimately it left a pretty bitter taste in the mouth. The concert was a
highlight of the year. This was just bland and only semi-memorable.

#Doug,
#
#my yahoo account eliminates italics; let me know if
#that's a problem. thanks for putting in the time.

straight list:
$Chappaquiddick Skyline, Chappaquiddick Skyline (Sub Pop)
$Joe Pernice, Big Tobacco (Spunk or Glitterhouse import)
$Clem Snide, Your Favorite Music (Sire)
$The Clientele, Suburban Light (Pointy import)
$MF Doom, Operation Doomsday (Fondle 'Em)
$Wu-Tang Clan, The W (Loud/Sony)
$The Comas, A Def Needle in Tomorrow (Yep Roc)
$Outkast, Stankonia (LaFace/Arista)
$Erykah Badu, Mama's Gun (Motown)
$Ryan Adams, Heartbreaker (Bloodshot)
$Trouble With Sweeney, The Trouble With Sweeney (Burnt Toast Vinyl)
$Quasimoto, The Unseen (Stones Throw)
$Bright Eyes, Fevers and Mirrors (Saddle Creek)
$Death Cab for Cutie, We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes (Barsuk)
$Ray's Vast Basement, On the Banks of the Time (self-released)
$Go-Betweens, The Friends of Rachel Worth (Jetset)

Singles from albums not in my list:
"Stan," Eminem
"Independent Woman, Part 1," Destiny's Child
"I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)," Jay-Z
"Danger," Mystikal

list w/annotation:
Chappaquiddick Skyline, Chappaquiddick Skyline (Sub
Pop)
Joe Pernice, Big Tobacco (Spunk or Glitterhouse
import)
I'm still listening to the first Pernice Brothers
album more than either of these (and more than
anything else), but these were no disappointments.
Imagine Burt Bacharach doing Songs From A Room.

Clem Snide, Your Favorite Music (Sire)
Even with the increased polish,and cheerier outlook,
this kind of chokes me up. They rock suits better than
Beachwood Sparks. They rock country better than
Beachwood Sparks, too.

The Clientele, Suburban Light (Pointy import)
While PJ Harvey mines Radio Ethiopia, The Clientele
extrapolate from V.U. III. Yes, there are probably too
many songs about rain.

Taj Mahal, The Real Thing (Sony Legacy)
I generally opted not to include re-issues on this
list; this euphoric 1971 live album, however, has
never before been available on CD. What I like about
the Grateful Dead circa '74 + what I like about Al
Green circa '74 = an album I love.

MF Doom, Operation Doomsday (Fondle 'Em)
Uses Marvel superhero samples better than Supreme
Clientele. 

Wu-Tang Clan, The W (Loud/Sony)
Uses Isaac Hayes' "Walk on By" better than MF Doom.
Even when it blows up and goes pop, it's still better
aggro than At the Drive-In.

The Comas, A Def Needle in Tomorrow (Yep Roc)
A startling amalgam of early 90s indie rock styles
admittedly caters to my biases, but this is too good
to be a guilty pleasure.

Outkast, Stankonia (LaFace/Arista)
Sly Stone>George Clinton>Prince>…finally. 

Erykah Badu, Mama's Gun (Motown)
She should produce the next Common album. And write
it, too.

Ryan Adams, Heartbreaker (Bloodshot)
Contains the best Highway 61 impression of the year,
and the best Nick Drake impression of the year, but
also the best Chris Isaak impression of the year. 

Trouble With Sweeney, The Trouble With Sweeney EP
(Burnt Toast Vinyl)
Sad country-pop songs about suburban love. Like the
Virgin Suicides film, but without all that soft focus.
 
Quasimoto, The Unseen (Stones Throw)
A deeper lunacy than Paul Barnam.

Bright Eyes, Fevers and Mirrors (Saddle Creek)
Jonathan Richman as wordy fatalist.

Death Cab for Cutie, We Have the Facts and We're
Voting Yes (Barsuk)
I wish this got louder. From what I've heard of their
EP, they're getting better. But I've only heard a
little.

Ray's Vast Basement, On the Banks of the Time
(self-released)
Better country-with-horns than Lambchop's Nixon.

Go-Betweens, The Friends of Rachel Worth (Jetset)
Maybe Yo La Tengo, Elliott Smith, and Modest Mouse
should look into ten-year sabbaticals. It worked for
the Go-Betweens.

#
#By the way Doug, I've been a Chug member for many years and I've picked up 
#that your from the Boston area; I live up in Portland, Maine right now but 
#am thinking pretty seriously about a move to your neighborhood shortly. I'd 
#love to hear what you think about boston, musically, culturally, etc. some 
#time. I wish this question was more formally stated but I couldn't help 
#putting myself out there. I've been reading your emails for years and 
#thought you might be able to offer some insight into the town.
#
#Hopefully I'll hear from you,
#Ben Macri

I was broke for most of the year, so there are still many records I
haven't heard that would probably make my list, like the newest ones
from the White Stripes and Vagtazo Halottkemek.
I'll only comment on the records from my home country cos I don't think
too many chugsters are familiar with them.
Finnish marginalia had a great year: lots of great records & gigs. 2000
was the kind of year we haven't experienced since the glory days of Bad
Vugum. What we're still lacking in Finland is bands who are more
influenced by Essential Logic or the Stretchheads than by Tortoise or
Sonic Youth.

Mental Market, Spooky (Popatak)
- Explosive & tuneful wall-of-guitar, killer choruses and madness-fueled
lyrics that would make Roky Erickson happy. They list Hawkwind & The
Bevis Frond as their influences. Surprisingly, this was the highlight of
the year for me. http://www.mentalmarket.com/

Radiopuhelimet, Oulu On Kaupungin Nimi (Bad Vugum)
- After a very disappointing album ("Hiljaista!") they made this, one of
their best. They've never sounded so relaxed yet tight in a (I guess)
carduccian sense of the word. Love 'em to death.
http://www.lpg.fi/badvugum/

Office Building, To See Only Shadows (Fonal)
- Led by Janne Laurila, a noise-kid who somehow metamorphosed into a
very talented songwriter with a shockingly beautiful singing voice.
Their debut album is full of folky, melancholic & timeless songs. The
solo gig I saw in late 1999 was one of the most moving experiences I've
ever witnessed, music or otherwise. Teemu Elo of Circle is the guitarist
in Office Building. http://www.fonal.com/ (seemed to be down)

Eturivi, Lempilapset 7" (Verdura)
- A project that's more or less a continuation of the Kirvasto project.
This has Kake Puhuu (AKA Keuhkot) ranting plus members of Circle &
Ektroverde providing the electro-pulsing background. I think you have to
be from Finland to fully appreciate what's going on in here. Maybe.
verdura@worldmailer.com

Platypus, Disco Recorder (Autotehtaat)
- One of the many secret weapons of the Finnish marginalia. On this CDr
they sound a lot like early Chrome with evil alien vocals, lots of weird
effects & kraut-ish rhythm work. They're still delightfully primitive in
their approach. http://www.uta.fi/~pm54740/platypus/

Festermen, Full Treatment (Bad Afro)
- They're from a small village in the middle of nowhere. Maybe that is
why they're so amazingly brutal. Motörhead colliding w/feedtime?
http://www.vow.dk/badafro/ and for just as good older records check:
http://www.sjoki.uta.fi/~latvis/levy-yhtiot/TrashCanRecords/index.html

Kemialliset Ystävät, Pieni Palatsi 7" (Vauva)
- Primitive backwoods psych, this is Jan Anderzen's finest & most
together release. For fans of Godz, Mourning Cloak, Amps For Christ &
the most sunburned moments of the Sun City Girls, I guess. Just check
the links page on their web site: http://members.vip.fi/~anderzen/

Es, A Love Cycle (Fonal)
- A solo project from Sam Zapkilla who runs Fonal Records and plays in
Kiila, Velvolino, Slaughterhouse Quintet and maybe a few others. Loops
made w/record players. Beautiful & spooky. http://www.fonal.com/ (seemed
to be down)

Mother Goose, Little Richard CD-ep (Seriously Groovy)
- Ridiculously ignored in their home country, Mother Goose had to be
signed to an English label for the second time (the first was Blast
First, remember? Oh, you don't?) to get a record out. It's great,
subdued, emotional (not emo!) guitar-based rock music, and, no, they
don't sound like Sonic Youth anymore.
http://www.seriouslygroovy.com/index.htm

That's all. Hope my English isn't too bad.

Sorry to bother, but I've recently discovered two records that will
definitely make my 2000 top 20 list. So could you please remove the
Movitone & .fuckingcom records from my list and put these in instead:

$Jackie-O Motherfucker, Fig. 5 (Road Cone)
$Six Organs Of Admittance, The Manifestation 12" (Ba Da Bing)

Again, sorry to bother you, but these records are so unbelievably great
that they must be included. Hope you understand. Thanks.

Reply-To: jodi@lexiconoclast.com

As is the tradition, my counts have some commentary.  

I want to start off by saying that I was made happy this year by a bunch of things, but mostly because someone had the sense to reissue that CONET PROJECT CD set.  After mine was stolen a few years back, I had just about given up hope of ever finding one again.   My list this year surprised me, mostly because it has an even larger scope than my lists usually have.  There's very few records in my list that are purely gut-level enjoyment (most of them have that, but usually there's more to it), whereas a lot of my lists of years past are 100% gut-level enjoyment records.  Maybe this means I'm becoming more of an adult, or more of a demanding listener.  That said, I had no problem finding 20 new records I loved.

In descending order of character count in the album title:

$1) I SAW IT ALL HAPPEN FROM BEGINNING TO END AND SOMETIMES I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I SAW/LIFE EVERLASTING, AMEN (Firework Editions)

$2) Harvey, PJ: STORIES FROM THE CITY STORIES FROM THE SEA (Island)

$3) Sun City Girls: CARNIVAL FOLKLORE RESURRECTION 1-6 (Abduction)

$4) V/A: LA MUSICA DE CUBA 1909 - 1951 (Sony Legacy)

$5) Cash, Johnny: AMERICAN III: SOLITARY MAN (American Recordings)

$6) Dead C: THE LANGUAGE RECORDINGS (Language)

$7) Laika: GOOD LOOKING BLUES (Too Pure UK)

$8) Clinic: INTERNAL WRANGLER (Domino UK)

$9) Senor Coconut y su Conjunto: EL BAILE ALEMAN (Emperor Norton)

$10) Sigur Ros: AGAETIS BYRJUN (Bad Taste, Iceland)

$11) Silkworm: LIFESTYLE (Touch and Go)

$12) Shellac: 1000 HURTS (Touch and Go)

$13) Primal Scream: XTRMNTR (Creation UK)

$14) Reed, Lou: ECSTASY (Sire)

$15) Merzbow: MERZBOX (Extreme)

$16) V/A TOUCH 00 (Touch UK)

$17) Teenage Fanclub: HOWDY! (Columbia UK)

$18) Radiohead: KID A (Capitol)

$19) Wu-Tang Clan: THE W (Loud/Columbia)

$20) Pole: 3 (Matador)

Comments:

1) I SAW IT ALL HAPPEN FROM BEGINNING TO END AND SOMETIMES I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I SAW/LIFE EVERLASTING, AMEN (Firework Editions)

I don't know which is the title and which is the "group" name.  Basically, an edit of an 8 hour recording of life support machines.  If you know me, you know why I liked this.  If you don't, feel free to ask me.

2) PJ Harvey: STORIES FROM THE CITY STORIES FROM THE SEA (Island)

So she lives in New York for a while and writes an album.  Big deal, right?  Wrong-o.  I'm glad my town inspired her to strap on the guitar again, and some of these songs are her best since RID OF ME, no mean feat.

3) Sun City Girls: CARNIVAL FOLKLORE RESURRECTION 1-6 (Abduction)

Uneven, but never uninteresting.  Even their bad records have something about them that's compelling.

4) V/A: LA MUSICA DE CUBA 1909 - 1951 (Sony Legacy)

Includes an early Desi Arnaz track.  Much, much stranger than you would think Cuban music is.   Assembled  from Columbia's early ethnic masters collection, it's 25 tracks of stuff you didn't know you needed.  It sort of fell betwixt the cracks, which is a shame.  In fact, someone gave me this as a promo, and if he hadn't, I probably wouldn't have come across it at all.  I'm not sure if it actually came out here in the States, but if it did, by all means, hunt it down and buy it.  


5) Johnny Cash: AMERICAN III: SOLITARY MAN (American Recordings)

On the wall of my cubicle of work is a Xerox copy of the American records ad that ran in Billboard (I think) where the words "American Recordings and Johnny Cash would like to acknowledge the Nashville music establishment and country radio for your support." are superimposed over a still photo from the LIVE AT SAN QUENTIN TV broadcast of The Man In Black flippin' the bird.  

Classic.

As is The Man himself.  Johnny's not merely a country singer, dammit.  He's a folk hero (evidenced by his grammy nomination for Best Folk Album this year) and I will continue to buy his records, and post that ad on my cubicle wall, until I slip the surly bonds of earth.  By covering such radio hits like "One" and "I Won't Back Down" as well as "I See A Darkness" -- *HIS* way -- he uncovers the bruised heart in each one.  Johnny knows what it's like to be hurt, and what it's like to do the hurtin'.  I guess that's why he'll always be number one on my post-breakup hit parade.

6) Dead C: THE LANGUAGE RECORDINGS (Language)

A two-disc set that reminded me a lot of the Omit 4 CD box that came out a few years ago.  I could write long, incoherent impressions of it, but I'll save it for later on in the poll results...

7) Laika: GOOD LOOKING BLUES (Too Pure UK)

Margaret rocks.  Easily their best album, all cool and sexy sounding.

8) Clinic: INTERNAL WRANGLER (Domino UK)

My friend John turned me on to this, and boy am I glad.   It's nostalgic in a reverent way, not an ironic way (thank fucking  god) and reminds me in a lot of ways of early Rolling Stones, the Gories,  Gallon Drunk,  the Velvet Underground (esp. on "2/4" which reminds me of a manic "Sister Ray"), Television, the Monks, to name a few.  It isn't mired in the past, though, which is probably why only 10 people heard this record this year.   It swaggers, it croons, it rocks.  Buy two copies so you can have one with you wherever you go.

9) Senor Coconut y su Conjunto: EL BAILE ALEMAN (Emperor Norton)

Most of the Atom Heart stuff I've heard was forgettable, but this record kept pulling me back by the sheer absurdity of its concept:  Kraftwerk songs re-written like Samba/Cumbia type songs.  And it actually *works*, in a really convincing way.  

10) Sigur Ros: AGAETIS BYRJUN (Bad Taste, Iceland)

Lush, ethereal, spooky, strange.  Pick an adjective.  Probably the record that got the most play by me this year, and, like Sparklehorse from two years ago, I bought copies of this for many people.  I forced people to buy it ("If you don't buy this record I will make fun of that Alanis Morrissette disc in your cabinet FOREVER and nobody wants that.") and played it to anyone who would listen.  I can't remember being so romantically involved with a record that's come out in the past 10 years.  It's the soundtrack to a million movies,  it's water and air committed to digital bits, it's the sound of faith.  Jeezum Crow, stop this descriptive logorrhea before I kill someone.

11) Silkworm: LIFESTYLE (Touch and Go)
12) Shellac: 1000 HURTS (Touch and Go)

I don't think I need to say anything about these in depth having written more than I should about both bands to begin with; two bands that make consistently interesting and great records.  The Shellac grew on me more than I thought it would, and seeing both bands live made me realize how lucky I am to live in a city where live music  is a given, instead of a treat.

13) Primal Scream: XTRMNTR (Creation UK)

A Japanese music magazine said it was the best protest album from a band that had no reason to protest anything.  Not SON OF SCREAMEDELICA as people had hoped, I suppose, but as good as that record was, albeit in different ways.

14) Lou Reed: ECSTASY (Sire)

A long time ago, I decided that Lou Reed's solo albums weren't as good as they should be, and yet I was compelled to keep buying them in the hope that he'd someday release one on par with THE BLUE MASK.  This year, I got my wish.  I dunno if it's Laurie Anderson's influence or what, but ECSTASY is the record he should have been making all along.  Others had their moments, but this one is aces all the way through.  "Baton Rouge" is a prime example of what Lou does best:  having the balls to sing the songs that people don't even have the guts to write.  

15) Merzbow: MERZBOX (Extreme)

Probably the most fun I had this year with a record was listening to all 50 discs of this (yes, I actually did listen to all of them) to cull tracks for a Merzbow Primer guest DJ spot on my pal Douglas' radio show (the playlist is <a href="http://www.wfmu.org/Playlists/Douglas/dw.000824.html">here</a>.)  I wanted to prove to people that Masami Akita is not just "the guy who sounds like static", but rather a man with a mission and a very clearly defined purpose.  I hope I did that.  Too bad Savage Pencil beat me to the punch and  wrote about him for THE WIRE, because I'm convinced that one of my purposes on this earth is to write the definitive piece on Merzbow.  Maybe I'll get my chance next box set.

16) V/A TOUCH 00 (Touch UK)

If it's released on Touch, there's a good chance I'll buy it, but this is the best label sampler I've ever heard.  Some tried-and-true, some newcomers, some flat-out surprises.  Type designers moonlighting as musicians.  Ex-Cabaret Voltaire people.  Snippets from a walking tour.  I can't think of  another compilation that's used 70+ minutes so effectively.

17) Teenage Fanclub: HOWDY! (Columbia UK)

A luscious pop record, the kind they made in the late 60's.  It sounds like Hello Kitty candy tastes, which is aces high in my book any day of the week.


18) Radiohead: KID A (Capitol)

Just when I thought concept albums were the suckiest concept ever, Radiohead pulled off something that I thought would be impossible: an isolationist record that pushes the listener away so much that you're absolutely compelled to keep listening.  Kinda like what I do in my personal life, but we'll leave that out of it for now.   Besides conveying a difficult emotional state in a convincing way throughout a whole song cycle, Radiohead have managed to make a record that's both intellectually satisfying *and* interesting sounding.  I hope more bands follow their example and explore this territory. 
 
19) Wu-Tang Clan: THE W (Loud/Columbia)

One of those rap outfits that makes records like the ones I grew up with.   The RZA's soundtrack to GHOST DOG was no slouch either.

20) Pole: 3 (Matador)
 
Probably the best dub record I've heard recently, more human sounding than most things of this ilk (I put him in the Scanner/Fennesz camp, even though he probably doesn't belong there.)  Points for listening to Mantronix's theory that tracks sound better with a layer of white noise/crackle over them (Warn Defever listened to that advice too, proving that it works cross-genre)

Reissues/live/other stuff/Weirdass recordings that don't fit anywhere else:

Faust THE WUMME YEARS
"Cvalda" Bjork (from SELMASONGS) (Elektra)
THE CONET PROJECT (Iridal-Disc UK)
Cale/Conrad/Maclise/Young/Zazeela: DAY OF NIAGARA
Johnny Cash AT SAN QUENTIN/AT FOLSOM PRISON (Columbia Legacy)
ESG: A SOUTH BRONX STORY
Monks: LET'S START A BEAT! 
Miles Davis ON THE CORNER (Columbia Legacy)
Raymond Scott MANHATTAN RESEARCH, INC (Basta)
Captain Beefheart I'M GOING DO WHAT I WANNA DO (Rhino Handmade)
Devo DEVO LIVE and RECOMBO DNA (Rhino Handmade)
Lou Reed METAL MACHINE MUSIC/LIVE TAKE NO PRISONERS/THE BELLS/CONEY ISLAND BABY (Buddha)
Fennesz: MUSIC FOR AN ISOLATION TANK
Elastica "Da Da Da"


That's it for this year.

#Hi Doug!
Here are good records from 2000 (or so -- I am not so sure about
the Finnish ones, though I know they take while to become available).  I
didn't hear too much this year, but these records I know well and find quite
good.
#  I'd like to add information later, if possible (a few sentences on
#each release, perhaps).  -Carl

#Hi Doug,

I've not put an entry in for a few years now but here goes.
Errmm...I don't think there was much from 2000 I liked actually.

Howzabout:

$DJ Rolando - The Aztec Mysic Mix (UR)

$ODB - Nigga Please (Elektra)

$Songs of Strength & Hearbreak - Mighty Wah (When)

$7 Live - John Carter vs Junior Cartier (7 Live)

$Blue Jam - Chris Morris (a bizarre 'comedy' compilation from the UK TV/Radio show with mainly Warp/Ninja Tune artists as a backdrop) (WARP)

$Fela: King Of Afrobeat - The Anthology (FAK)

$St Germain - Rose Rouge 12" (Blue Note)

$Dead Prez - Let's Get Free (Loud/Epic)

$Ludovic Navarre - From Detroit To St Germian (F-Comm)

$Black Eyed Peas - Bridging The Gap (Interscope)

$Kraftwerk - Expo 2000 12" (EMI)

That's about it. I was a bit retro last year!

This is a pretty "safe" list (i.e. nothing particularly edgy), but it's also
a pretty accurate snapshot of the 2000 releases/re-releases I enjoyed the
most, so here goes:

$1. Badly Drawn Boy - The Hour of Bewilderbeast (Beggar's Banquet)
$2. Air - Virgin Suicides S/T (Astralwerks)
$3. Air - Premiers Symptomes (Astralwerks) (1999)
$4. The New Pornographers - Mass Romantic (Mint)
$5. King Biscuit Time - No Style EP (Astralwerks)
$6. Johnny Cash - American III: Solitary Man (Columbia)
$7. Various Artists - Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? Soundtrack (Mercury)
$8. Radiohead - Kid A (Capitol)
$9. Yo La Tengo - And Then Nothing Turned Itself... (Matador)
$10. Cat Stevens - Teaser & The Firecat Reissue (A&M)

I was particularly disappointed by the new releases from Belle & Sebastian &
PJ Harvey.  Sleater-Kinney just missed my list, but I swear they're starting
to grown on me...

The releases I listened to the most aren't listed above as they were two of
my favorites for 1999, & I haven't grown tired of them yet: The Beta Band's
Three E.P.'s and Belle & Sebastian's Tigermilk.  Great music for lazy Sunday
afternoons.  Nothing released in 2000 hooked me quite the same way, but the
CDs on my list each contain at least one track I enjoy that much (and in the
same way).

#Subject: [chugchanga-l] POLL 2000 POLL 2000 POLL 2000
#
#
#As the millennium finally draws to a close, I still haven't gotten
#around to fiddling with the poll applet like I wanted to, but I'm
#going to officially open the poll anyway and revert to the low-tech of
#previous years.  So, please send your entry to me by email
#(dougo@ccs.neu.edu) before the end of January.  I still plan on
#getting the web stuff working in the next couple weeks, but I'm not
#going to make any promises.
#
#WHAT TO SEND ME
#---------------
#
#Send me a list of your favorite records released in 2000 (eligibility
#requirements are in the next section).  For each record, specify the
#artist name, record title, and label name (and band and/or label
#contact info if it's a particurly obscure release).  This poll has two
#purposes: one is to tally up a non-scientific ranking of chugchanga-l
#members' favorite records, but the other is to collect, organize, and
#present all your individual lists in one place, namely my poll web
#site ( http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dougo/poll/
#<http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dougo/poll/> ).  Consequently, you
#should send me your list of however many records you feel like
#mentioning, with or without ranking, along with whatever annotations
#and commentary you'd like to appear alongside the list.  For the
#purposes of tallying, though, I will only consider the top 20 (or
#fewer, if your list is shorter) and they will be equally weighted.
#But the whole thing will appear on its own page on the site (let me
#know if you want your name and/or email address removed before
#posting).
#
#To make things a little easier for me, it would help if you could put
#your top 20 list in some regularized format, perhaps duplicated
#separately from your more free-form list + commentary.  It doesn't
#matter too much what the format is, as long as it's something I can
#semi-automatically process into a database-- otherwise it becomes
#manual data entry for me, which is kind of a drag.  Here's a suggested
#format:
#
#  Artist Name, _Record Title_ (Label Name)
#
#The artist name should be alphabetizable, i.e. last name first and move
#"the" to the end.  Use "Various Artists" for compilations.
#
#
#WHAT RECORDS COUNT
#------------------
#
#Basically, any audio product that was officially released or
#re-released in 2000 is fair game.  I'll even bend it a little and
#allow things that came out late in 1999, since as we all know indie
#distribution can be pretty slow and records might not ever get heard
#until a few months after their release.  As a rule of thumb, if a
#record was mentioned in last year's poll, it's not eligible in this
#year's (unless it was re-released).
#
#More specifically: reissues, compilations, singles, EPs, LPs, double
#live albums, 10-CD box sets, 8-tracks, eMusic mp3s, are all eligible.
#Not eligible: bootlegs, radio promo records, demo tapes, masters
#leaked to Napster.  The key phrase is "officially released", the idea
#being that it should be something other people can track down and
#legally obtain if they want to.
#
#WHAT "FAVORITE" MEANS
#---------------------
#
#Whatever you want it to mean.  But I'd rather get a list of guilty
#pleasures that you played over and over again than a list of
#"respectable" or "important" records that never left your shelf all
#year.  Also, don't feel you have to limit it to records that would be
#considered "on-topic" for this list-- but if your entire list is made
#up of boy-bands on Jive Records, you'll probably need to explain what
#it is about them that made them your favorites (and why you read this
#list)...  Finally, please don't worry about "conflict of interest";
#just because you were artistically or financially responsible for
#making something you happen to love doesn't mean people here aren't
#going to want to know about it too.
#
#As always, your questions, comments, and suggestions are welcomed.
#
#Oh yeah, and happy new year.

Music that made me happy in 2000 (in no particular order):

$Silkworm - Lifestyle (and live at the Empty Bottle)
$High Dependency Unit - Memento Mori (and one hell of a live show)
$Storm & Stress - Under Thunder and Fluorescent Light
$Shellac - 1000 Hurts
$Radiohead - Kid A
$Sigur Ros - Aegatis Byrjun
$Lassie Foundation - Pacifico
The Dictators live at the Empty Bottle
Mirror America live at the Beat Kitchen (John Lee of aMiniture fame, Noah L.
of Hurl fame, and Andy Cohen of Silkworm, and the bass player of the day)

To be honest the majority of music I bought in 2000 wasn't made/released
in 1990 let alone 2000 but all of the above items made my year much more
enjoyable.
