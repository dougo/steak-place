Singles from albums not in my list:<br>
"Stan," Eminem<br>
"Independent Woman, Part 1," Destiny's Child<br>
"I Just Wanna Love U (Give It 2 Me)," Jay-Z<br>
"Danger," Mystikal<br>
<br>
list w/annotation:<br>
Chappaquiddick Skyline, Chappaquiddick Skyline (Sub<br>
Pop)<br>
Joe Pernice, Big Tobacco (Spunk or Glitterhouse<br>
import)<br>
I'm still listening to the first Pernice Brothers<br>
album more than either of these (and more than<br>
anything else), but these were no disappointments.<br>
Imagine Burt Bacharach doing Songs From A Room.<br>
<br>
Clem Snide, Your Favorite Music (Sire)<br>
Even with the increased polish,and cheerier outlook,<br>
this kind of chokes me up. They rock suits better than<br>
Beachwood Sparks. They rock country better than<br>
Beachwood Sparks, too.<br>
<br>
The Clientele, Suburban Light (Pointy import)<br>
While PJ Harvey mines Radio Ethiopia, The Clientele<br>
extrapolate from V.U. III. Yes, there are probably too<br>
many songs about rain.<br>
<br>
Taj Mahal, The Real Thing (Sony Legacy)<br>
I generally opted not to include re-issues on this<br>
list; this euphoric 1971 live album, however, has<br>
never before been available on CD. What I like about<br>
the Grateful Dead circa '74 + what I like about Al<br>
Green circa '74 = an album I love.<br>
<br>
MF Doom, Operation Doomsday (Fondle 'Em)<br>
Uses Marvel superhero samples better than Supreme<br>
Clientele. <br>
<br>
Wu-Tang Clan, The W (Loud/Sony)<br>
Uses Isaac Hayes' "Walk on By" better than MF Doom.<br>
Even when it blows up and goes pop, it's still better<br>
aggro than At the Drive-In.<br>
<br>
The Comas, A Def Needle in Tomorrow (Yep Roc)<br>
A startling amalgam of early 90s indie rock styles<br>
admittedly caters to my biases, but this is too good<br>
to be a guilty pleasure.<br>
<br>
Outkast, Stankonia (LaFace/Arista)<br>
Sly Stone&gt;George Clinton&gt;Prince&gt;…finally. <br>
<br>
Erykah Badu, Mama's Gun (Motown)<br>
She should produce the next Common album. And write<br>
it, too.<br>
<br>
Ryan Adams, Heartbreaker (Bloodshot)<br>
Contains the best Highway 61 impression of the year,<br>
and the best Nick Drake impression of the year, but<br>
also the best Chris Isaak impression of the year. <br>
<br>
Trouble With Sweeney, The Trouble With Sweeney EP<br>
(Burnt Toast Vinyl)<br>
Sad country-pop songs about suburban love. Like the<br>
Virgin Suicides film, but without all that soft focus.<br>
 <br>
Quasimoto, The Unseen (Stones Throw)<br>
A deeper lunacy than Paul Barnam.<br>
<br>
Bright Eyes, Fevers and Mirrors (Saddle Creek)<br>
Jonathan Richman as wordy fatalist.<br>
<br>
Death Cab for Cutie, We Have the Facts and We're<br>
Voting Yes (Barsuk)<br>
I wish this got louder. From what I've heard of their<br>
EP, they're getting better. But I've only heard a<br>
little.<br>
<br>
Ray's Vast Basement, On the Banks of the Time<br>
(self-released)<br>
Better country-with-horns than Lambchop's Nixon.<br>
<br>
Go-Betweens, The Friends of Rachel Worth (Jetset)<br>
Maybe Yo La Tengo, Elliott Smith, and Modest Mouse<br>
should look into ten-year sabbaticals. It worked for<br>
the Go-Betweens.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
