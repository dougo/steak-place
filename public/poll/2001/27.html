<hr><h1>Eric Hoffsten's Chugchanga-L Poll 2001 Entry</h1>

A sad, sad year in so, so many ways.  I know, I know... in my attempt to<br>
represent every month of the year while simultaneously keeping the list<br>
close to 20, I've inevitably left off several other notable "releases."<br>
Looking at the list below, September wasn't such a bad month compared to<br>
some of the others.  Yeesh, June was bad enough w/out my throwing in Joe<br>
Henderson and Chico O'Farrill...<br>
<br>
1.  Jerry Wick   (January)<br>
2.  John Fahey   (February)<br>
3.  Dale Evans   (February)<br>
4.  Iannis Xenakis   (February)<br>
5.  Robert Ealey   (March)<br>
6.  Papa John Phillips   (March)<br>
7.  Sandy Bull   (April)<br>
8.  Joey Ramone   (April)<br>
9.  Billy Higgins   (May)<br>
10.  Boozo Chavis   (May)<br>
11.  Chet Atkins   (June)<br>
12.  John Hartford   (June)<br>
13.  John Lee Hooker   (June)<br>
14.  Fred Neil   (July)<br>
15.  Mimi Farina   (July)<br>
16.  Color Blind James   (July)<br>
17.  Ron Townson   (August)<br>
18.  Jay Migliori   (September)<br>
19.  Rusty Kershaw   (October)<br>
20.  George Harrison   (November)<br>
21.  Rufus Thomas   (December)<br>
<br>
Okay, in looking over my list I realized I have to add three more, two of<br>
which managed to squeak in during the last couple weeks of the year. The<br>
other I simply momentarily overlooked. Sigh. What a fucking year.<br>
<br>
20.33  Michael Karoli (November)<br>
21.33  Florian Fricke (December)<br>
21.66  Gareth Williams (December)<br>
