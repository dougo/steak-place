<a href="byartist.html#califone-roomsound">Califone, Roomsound (perishable)</a><br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#life-without-buildings-any-other-city">Life without Buildings, Any Other City (Tugboat)</a><br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#nitzsche-jack-three-piece-suite">Jack Nitzsche, Three Piece Suite(rhinohandmade)--could be dq'ed as I didn't</a><br>
get my copy until january of '02 but it was suppposed to come out in 2001<br>
and I waited very impatiently for it.  I understand even better now why<br>
Mercury Rev wanted<br>
Nitzsche to produce the record that became "All is Dream" as there is one<br>
Nitzsche song--Marie--that in a little under 3 minutes gets most of what<br>
Mercury Rev has been chasing on the last 2 albums.  Some of the other songs<br>
from what would have been his singer-songwriter record on Reprise are<br>
lousy--in some cases it seems he was more interested in the instrumental<br>
codas than the songs themselves.  But the codas... And  "Marie" and "Lower<br>
California" are great.  Lyrics by Robert Downey Sr. aren't bad either when<br>
they aren't overly sentimental<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#velvet-underground-quine-tapes">Velvet Underground, The Quine Tapes (polygram/dor)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#haggard-merle-roots-vol-1">Merle Haggard Roots Volume 1 (Anti)</a><br>
<br>
can't vote for any others because I did not hear them.  But based on one<br>
song each that I did hear, US Maple, Acre Thrills and Neil Michael Haggerty<br>
solo record are records I will make a point of hearing.<br>
