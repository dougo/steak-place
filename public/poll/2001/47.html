<hr><h1>Jodi Shapiro's Chugchanga-L Poll 2001 Entry</h1>

<br>
I can't put Clinic on my list because it made my list last year, <br>
ditto for Sigur Ros.  Instead, enjoy the wierdness that is my 2001 <br>
list.<br>
<br>
I sort of OD'ed on the electronic stuff this year, both beat-oriented <br>
and non-beat oriented.   Since I spent about 5 months out of this <br>
year not working for real money but raher in the darkroom making <br>
"art", having music around that shortened the hours was essential, <br>
hence the heavy presence of experimental electronic stuff (I refuse <br>
to call it IDM, dammit.)<br>
<br>
No particular order because I can't think of a good way to order them <br>
this year:<br>
<br>
Albums<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#low-things-we-lost-in-fire">Low -- THINGS WE LOST IN THE FIRE (Kranky)</a><br>
What a beautiful record.  It's sparse in places, violent in others.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#bjork-vespertine">Bjork -- VESPERTINE (Elektra)</a><br>
I was telling someone recently that if someone like Bjork can be <br>
popular, get played on the radio, and still make records as <br>
unconventional as this, then there's hope for mankind's musical <br>
tastes after all.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#hazard-wind">Hazard -- WIND (Touch UK)</a><br>
Yeah, it's based on field recordings of wind.  Your point?<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#gescom">Gescom -- GESCOM (Warp UK)</a><br>
On minidisc only, engineered for random shuffle play.  I am guilty of <br>
putting "Yo! DMX Crew" on repeat for hours at a time whilst in the <br>
darkroom.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#autechre-confield">Autechre -- CONFIELD (Warp)</a><br>
The other side of Gescom, as it were.  These guys just get better and <br>
better.  I can't wait to hear the next one.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#hellfish-meat-machine-broadcast-system">Hellfish -- MEAT MACHINE BROADCAST SYSTEM (Planet Mu UK)</a><br>
Reminds me a whole lot of the shows I used to go to at The Fever as a <br>
teen.  Not so much in sound, but in feel.  This whole disc sounds <br>
like it was recorded in a club, with a boomin' bass and a feeling of <br>
space.  I can almost feel the bodies dancing next to me.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#radiohead-amnesiac">Radiohead -- AMNESIAC (Capitol)</a><br>
See last year's comments about KID A.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#avalanches-since-i-left-you">The Avalanches -- SINCE I LEFT YOU (XL UK)</a><br>
I have a friend named Steve who is always looking for a Summer Disc; <br>
basically the album he will play to death in the summertime on the <br>
way to work, at work, in the car.  If I were given to such <br>
tendencies, SINCE I LEFT YOU would be my Summer Disc.  It's like <br>
going to a loft party where five different DJ's are playing in <br>
separate parts of the space.  As you saunter through the place <br>
looking for the pals you're supposed to meet there, you hear each DJ <br>
doing his/her thing.  You pick out snippets of what they're playing <br>
and get these little "Aha!" moments, like "Hey, that's DEBBIE <br>
REYNOLDS!" or "Oh man, I haven't heard this song in years."  It's <br>
kinda like nostalgia in a bottle.  That's what listening to this <br>
record is like.  Someone gave me the demo version of this and it's a <br>
little different, with more "Aha!" moments.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#sparklehorse-it-s-a-wonderful-life">Sparklehorse -- IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (Capitol)</a><br>
Mark Linkous has a gentle soul, and he writes tender songs.  Tender <br>
like a skinned knee.  Tender like a furtive first kiss.  Both at the <br>
same time.  A rare feat, that.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#dumb-type-memorandum">Dumb Type -- MEMORANDUM (CCI Japan)</a><br>
I probably played this record more than any other on this list.  It <br>
was a staple at work (when I actually had a job) and I copied it to <br>
minidisc so I could listen to it in the darkroom.  Dumb Type are a <br>
Japanese (surprise!) artist collective.  Memorandum is about memory <br>
and recall, and it was an oddly fitting record for September.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#new-year-newness-ends">The New Year -- NEWNESSENDS (Touch and Go)</a><br>
Probably the most overtly rock record on my list, next to Lightning Bolt.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#frost-edith-wonder">Edith Frost -- WONDER WONDER (Drag City)</a><br>
She gets better with every album, songwriting-wise.  This one sounds <br>
so incredible, it only takes about two songs for me to get <br>
misty-eyed.  It's hard to be a tough bitch when Edith sings.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#spiritualized-let-it-come-down">Spiritualized -- LET IT COME DOWN (Arista)</a><br>
Is Jason clean now?  Or has Jesus replaced heroin? Spiritualized's <br>
gospel album, a record that I liked immediately but it took a few <br>
weeks for it to blossom into a record I ended up thinking was better <br>
than LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...which I had feared would be their <br>
creative apex.  Glad I was wrong.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#deltron-3030-deltron-3030">Deltron 3030 -- DELTRON 3030 (75 Ark)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#gorillaz">Gorillaz -- GORILLAZ (Virgin)</a><br>
Made by the same people, sort of.  Two different sides of the <br>
12-sided die, as it were.  I love Del, and if the Automator has <br>
something to do with it, I'm there.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#squarepusher-go-plastic">Squarepusher -- GO PLASTIC (Warp)</a><br>
Every record Tom Jenkinson makes is different.  This one is, I guess, <br>
his ADD record.  I really loved listening to this on the subway, for <br>
which it is a fitting companion piece.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#toby-dammit-top-dollar">Toby Dammit -- TOP DOLLAR (Omplatten)</a><br>
I have a confession to make:  I want to play in Toby Dammit's band so <br>
much it hurts.  I see him at shows quite often (he's hard to miss, I <br>
think) and am still too chicken to tell him personally.  Instead, I <br>
sort of stare at him and try to will him to look my way and say "Hey! <br>
I need another drummer..."  TOP DOLLAR is the beat record of the <br>
year, I think.  While Squarepusher has the electronic beats down to a <br>
skittery science, Toby Dammit makes a record that humans (albeit 16 <br>
of them) could play live on actual percussion rather than computers. <br>
Points for the Poe reference.  Note to Mr. Dammit:  I can play <br>
guitar, singing saw, and several flavors of handheld drums.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#lightning-bolt-ride-skies">Lightning Bolt -- RIDE THE SKIES (Load)</a><br>
I have this habit of wearing sandals to rock shows in the summer.  I <br>
can't break myself of it because if there's one thing I can't fucking <br>
stand it's sweaty socks.  You'd think, after four consecutive summers <br>
of broken pinky toes, that I would wear more protective footwear to a <br>
show where the crowd tends to be active.<br>
<br>
Learn from my mistakes:  Lighting Bolt shows are the very worst place <br>
to wear a pair of Birkenstocks.  Their show at the Right Bank in <br>
Williamsburg was one of the most violent shows I've ever been to.  A <br>
roiling sea of 24 year olds trying to mimic the salad days of CBGB.<br>
<br>
  Number of times I got smacked in the face: 4<br>
  Number of times I was targeted by another girl for abuse: 10+<br>
  Number of times a guy felt he had to protect me: 3<br>
  Number of times a guy tried to pick a fight with me: 1<br>
<br>
Despite the violence in others, I ended up taking my aggressions out <br>
on people as well, which in the end was very healthy for my psyche, <br>
but not my poor little toes.  I think if all the depressed people in <br>
New York went to see Lightning Bolt, 85% of the shrinks here would be <br>
out of business the next day.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#leafcutter-john-microcontact">Leafcutter John -- MICROCONTACT (Planet Mu UK)</a><br>
Most of you have never heard of Leafcutter John.  It's OK, really, <br>
because then there's more of him for me.  He's classified as IDM, but <br>
really, he's wholly other.  Tweaked field recordings, use of <br>
"non-musician" musicians, stuff like that.  Clearly the work of <br>
someone who a) doesn't give a fuck what I (or you, or anyone) think <br>
of his musical output and b) is very in touch with his surroundings, <br>
MICROCONTACT is a record you really can't go wrong with if you're <br>
into experimental electronics.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#aphex-twin-drukqs">Aphex Twin -- DRUQKS (Warp/Sire)</a><br>
Half RDJ doing the stuff he does best, and half these piano <br>
instrumentals that I, for one, would like to hear more of. <br>
Interesting stuff, not consistent at all (probably would have made a <br>
killer single album) but a pretty lucid window into how his mind has <br>
been working the past few years.  Plus, you get to hear his mom <br>
calling him for dinner and wishing him happy birthday.<br>
<br>
Compilations/Reissues/other stuff<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#doormouse-album">Doormouse -- THE ALBUM? (Massive)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#v-a-cosmic-forces-of-mu">V/A -- THE COSMIC FORCES OF MU (Planet Mu UK)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#liliput">LiLiPUT 2XCD (Kill Rock Stars)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#v-a-ringtones">V/A -- RINGTONES (Touch UK)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#your-favourite-london-sounds">YOUR FAVOURITE LONDON SOUNDS (LMC)</a><br>
Seeing Kid 606 at 93 Feet East, London, on September 13th<br>
Playing as burun in someone's loft in London on September 12th, and <br>
getting a huge positive reaction (possibly because I was from New <br>
York, but I hope it was because they liked my stuff.)<br>
<br>
(Actually, playing *any* gig in 2001 was good.  I finally got off my <br>
ass and started playing regularly, breaking my tradition of "one gig <br>
a year or die" to little tiny pieces. Now I play once a week and it's <br>
incredibly fun and liberating.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Singles<br>
<br>
Missy Elliott -- "Get Ur Freak On"<br>
bit_meddler -- "Shitmix 2000" (Planet Mu)<br>
