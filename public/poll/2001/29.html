<hr><h1>Joe Willette's Chugchanga-L Poll 2001 Entry</h1>

<a href="byartist.html#prefuse-73-vocal-studies-uprock-narratives-warp">  #1) Prefuse 73: Vocal Studies and Uprock Narratives:  Warp</a><br>
   - the perfect mix of IDM and Hip Hop.<br>
<br>
  rest in no order<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#brian-jonestown-massacre-bravery-repetition-noise-bomp-records">  2) Brian Jonestown Massacre: Bravery Repetition and Noise: Bomp Records</a><br>
Very dark psychedelic stuff.  Track 5 is especially fantastic. <br>
Extremely claustrophobic production The album falls apart a bit towards<br>
the end, but that seems appropriate.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#bullfrog-ropeadope">  3) Bullfrog: Bullfrog: Ropeadope</a><br>
Underrated outing with Kid Koala in a happy funk band.  Cool stuff!<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#white-stripes-white-blood-cells">  4) White Stripes:  White Blood Cells:  Sympathy for the Record Industry</a><br>
Detroit Rock City! A close contender for #1<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#aesop-rock-labor-days">  5) Aesop Rock: Labor Days:  Def Jux</a><br>
Brilliant Hip Hop from the underground.  Very refreshing for those sick of the gangsta thing.  Track 4 is my favorite.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#slayer-god-hates-us-all-american">  6) Slayer: God Hates Us All:  American</a><br>
F**K Nu Metal, this kicks serious but over any metal out there, even Botch and its ilk.  Being released on September 11 was a nice touch.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#new-year-newness-ends">  7) New Year: Newness Ends:  Touch and Go</a><br>
Ex-members of Come - a little more downbeat than Come but still very good.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#v-a-rapid-transit-chocolate-industries">  8) Various Artists:  Rapid Transit:  Chocolate Industries</a><br>
Prefuse 73 and friends (late 2000 release)<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#plaid-double-figure-warp">  9) Plaid:  Double Figure:  Warp</a><br>
Very nice electronica<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#burnside-rl-burnside-on-burnside-fat-possum">  10) RL Burnside: Burnside on Burnside:  Fat Possum</a><br>
Live Mississippi Blues at its rawest and finest.  A touchstone disc for RL.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#cannibal-ox-cold-vein">  11) Cannibal Ox: Cold Vein:  Def Jux</a><br>
another fine Hip Hop release.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#fugazi-argument">  12) Fugazi: The Argument: Dischord</a><br>
Fugazi rediscovers melody<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#beulah-coast-is-never-clear-velocette">  13)  Beulah:  The Coast is Never Clear:  Velocette</a><br>
The single is excellent as well.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#shins-oh-inverted-world">  14)  The Shins, Oh, Inverted World: Sub Pop</a><br>
Happy guitar music<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#black-rebel-motorcycle-club">  15)  Black Rebel Motorcycle Club: B.R.M.C.:  Virgin</a><br>
They should have gotten the Strokes hype.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#preston-school-of-industry-all-this-sounds-gas">  16) Preston School of Industry:  All This is Gas:  Matador</a><br>
Ex-Pavement-I thought this was better than the Malkmus disc.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#jucifer-lambs-ep-velocette">  17)  Jucifer:  The Lambs EP: Velocette</a><br>
Very heavy metal with sweet female vocals<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#foetus-flow-thirsty-ear">  18) Foetus: Flow: Thirsty Ear</a><br>
Thirlwell shows he's still got some spunk in him!<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#guided-by-voices-isolation-drills">  19) Guided By Voices: Isolation Drills:  TVT</a><br>
Can't deny the classic rock.  I was very tempted to list Pollard's Choreographed Man of War release instead.  They still put on a great show.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#zedek-thalia-been-here-gone">  20) Thalia Zedek: Been There and Gone: Matador</a><br>
First solo since Come.  Very pretty and sort of sad.<br>
<br>
  Best Show:  Mike Watt and Jom and Terry Show in Charlottesville, VA. <br>
I thought the Minuteman were back together!<br>
