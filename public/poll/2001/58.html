<hr><h1>Geoff Cox's Chugchanga-L Poll 2001 Entry</h1>

Here goes for the tops of 2001.  In no particular order at all.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#shins-oh-inverted-world">The Shins - Oh, Inverted World. Sub Pop.</a><br>
dreamy, silly, etc.  "New Slang" is my song of the year, and, according to<br>
rumor, will be McDonalds', too.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#chills-secret-box">The Chills - Secret Box.</a><br>
Definitive.  Easy to forget how great this band is/was.  A full smattering of everything from practice tapes to outtakes.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#juno-a-future-lived-in-past-tense">Juno - A Future lived in past tense. DeSoto.</a><br>
Huge sounding post-emo stuff.  Complicated, 3 guitar caterwaul.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#wipers-box">The Wipers - Box Set (Is this Real?; Youth of America; Over the Edge) Zeno Records.</a><br>
(reissue) Amazing.  The best punk I've heard in years and years.<br>
Valid on its own terms, 20 years after the fact.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#blumfeld-testament-der-angst">Blumfeld - Testament der Angst</a><br>
Their "l'etat et moi" (1995) is what I<br>
consider to be the epitome about all that is/was good with independent<br>
music from the mid-90s.  Too bad no one noticed.  The new one is much more<br>
mainstream, but still deals with existential issues in a (now) more shiny<br>
"we've only been listening to the last few Talk Talk records" kind of way.<br>
Jochen Distelmeyer is one of the most poignant lyricists out there now.<br>
Even if only in German.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#chameleons-why-call-it-anything">The Chameleons - Why Call it Anything?</a><br>
Only their fourth studio album and it is right up there with the three<br>
pre-1987.  It's great to hear that they're still churning out great,<br>
isolated pop songs.  Also keeps up the tradition of terrible, off-putting<br>
covers, this one with a clown influence.  Shudder.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#radiohead-amnesiac">Radiohead - Amnesiac.  EMI.</a><br>
Kid A-.  Still in top 5% of class.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#strokes-is-this-it">The Strokes - Is This It?</a><br>
I'm a sucker, but it sure sounds right.<br>
If the "Modern Age" ep blows doors, this one is a sound, if less<br>
effective, knocking.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#idlewild-100-broken-windows">Idlewild - 100 Broken Windows. Capitol.</a><br>
what Jack Rapid said. [Also gets<br>
points for the label promotion of this selling for $4.99 for a while,<br>
before they cancelled the tour.]<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#leatherface-minx-byo">Leatherface - Minx. BYO.</a><br>
Frankie Stubbs should never quit smoking.  I<br>
guess the damage to his voice is done, though.  Very good reissue for one<br>
of the worst named bands in rock.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#jim-yoshii-pileup-it-s-winter-here-absolutely-kosher">Jim Yoshii Pileup - It's winter here. Absolutely Kosher.</a><br>
Quiet, nice.<br>
Bedhead-y.  Heartbreaking.  No guys named "Bubba," which could be a plus<br>
or minus, depending.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#divine-comedy-regeneration-parlophone">Divine Comedy - Regeneration. Parlophone</a><br>
Neil Hammond is brilliant.  The<br>
"Koerperwelten" inspired cover hides nice pop songs underneath.  Get<br>
"Secret History" first, though.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#pernice-brothers-world-won-t-end">Pernice Brothers - The world won't end. Ashmont.</a><br>
More shimmering pop from Joe Pernice.  Almost too much so, but still a<br>
wonderful summer record.  Contains lyrical couplet of the year:<br>
"contemplating suicide or a graduate degree / ask me how its going and I<br>
feel sullen I feel sullen I feel seventeen."<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#red-house-painters-old-ramon"> Red House Painters - Old Ramon. Subpop.</a><br>
Old songs, Old tapes, Old feeling.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#trembling-blue-stars-alive-to-every-smile-sub-pop">Trembling Blue Stars - Alive to Every Smile. Sub Pop.</a><br>
Cute and fragile.<br>
Heard some call up my bloody valentine in comparison (?!).  If so, then a<br>
grade school Kevin Shield's just got his lunch money stolen.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#stereo-total-musique-automatique-telepop">Stereo Total - Musique Automatique. Telepop.</a><br>
English as a second language/ Deutsch als Fremdsprache cuteness.  Except<br>
for the sex noises.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#vnv-nation-genesis-1-2-metropolis">VNV Nation - Genesis 1&amp;2.  Metropolis.</a><br>
When they played in Seattle, the<br>
singer asked a full house of goths "Are you happy?"  They all screamed<br>
"Yes."  Can't get any more surreal than that.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#notwist-pilot-12-community">The Notwist - Pilot 12".  community.</a><br>
Melding Atari 2600 and Richard Butler, somehow.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#bjork-vespertine">Bjork - Vespertine. Elektra.</a><br>
At a dinner at a vegan chinese restaurant a<br>
few weeks ago, they were playing all sorts of background chimes and<br>
(possibly) traditional music that was alternately soothing and very<br>
creepy.  Bjork's record is not all that different.  Bonus points for<br>
making (having made) music boxes for the songs.<br>
<br>
