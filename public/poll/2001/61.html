<hr><h1>Max Daniels's Chugchanga-L Poll 2001 Entry</h1>

Well, this year as always, I didn't buy a lot of new things, and I listened<br>
to a few older things obsessively (Cave-In's <cite>Jupiter</cite>, for example). But<br>
here's a couple things that came out in 2001 that I liked:<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#black-rebel-motorcycle-club">*Black Rebel Motorcycle Club: BRMC</a><br>
This is a nearly perfect record. I've played it every day, three times a<br>
day, since I got it a couple weeks ago. How did I manage to miss this<br>
before? It's the cure for everything that ails you, and you can really sing<br>
along with it loud. If you're tired it'll revive you; if you're irritable<br>
it'll soothe you; if you're sad it'll cheer you, and if you're just too<br>
fucking ecstatic, as sometimes happens, it'll steady you. If the Jesus and<br>
Mary Chain had made this album, I might've made it through art school in one<br>
piece.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#new-pornographers-mass-romantic">*New Pornographers: Mass Romantic</a><br>
Very very confectionary. But it's not all empty calories! Nice supporting<br>
layers of crunchiness under the sugar. I don't dig Country Neko that much,<br>
but I sure like Pop Neko. And I *really* dig the frolicsome cover...<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#monster-magnet-god-says-no">*Monster Magnet: God Says No</a><br>
8-year-old:  Mom, is this rock and roll?<br>
Me:  Yep. Like it?<br>
8-year-old:  No, it sucks.<br>
Me:  But honey, you love Monster Magnet! Remember <cite>Space Lord</cite>? That was<br>
your favorite song when you were 5.<br>
8-year-old:  No it wasn't. Can we get the Lord of the Rings soundtrack?<br>
Me:  . o 0 ( Hmmm. Maybe this record lacks the fiery blast of <cite>Powertrip</cite><br>
because it's all about God instead of Satan...)<br>
Anyway, *I* liked it. It's got a nice fat sound and you can scream to it.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#kinski-be-gentle-with-warm-turtle">*Kinski: Be Gentle with the Warm Turtle</a><br>
I don't understand this title. Makes you think it's going to be the perfect<br>
soporific. It won't put you to sleep, but it won't make your friends yell<br>
'Don't drive angry!' either. It's somewhere in the middle. I liked it when<br>
it came out, and then I forgot about it til they toured the East Coast. They<br>
were much louder than they are on the record...<br>
(PS: However, the day I wrote the above, I performed a test and tucked<br>
myself in with <cite>Turtle</cite>. Knocked me out instantly...)<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#weezer-green-album">*Weezer: 'the Green Album'</a><br>
I don't understand this record. I've listened to it over and over, trying to<br>
figure out where the old Weezer is in it. <cite>Say it Ain't So</cite> is one of my<br>
*all-time favorite* songs. Pinkerton is a good record that I kind of ignored<br>
until a couple years ago, but there's really more operatic anguish in the<br>
last five minutes of the first album than on all of Pinkerton, the opera<br>
record. And now this Green Album. What a sad trajectory. This record seems<br>
very sort of dull-witted to me, most especially the song that I imagine was<br>
a radio hit, <cite>Hash Pipe</cite>. The more I've listened, the more I understand the<br>
bitter reviews with their sense of personal betrayal. At first I thought,<br>
Jesus people, overreact much? But really, there's no here here. I'm<br>
including it provisionally because of <cite>Crab</cite>, which I've persuaded myself to<br>
hear as acid misery meets self-mocking contempt in a gush of gorgeous<br>
guitars, which is to say, classic Weezer. I guess that could be up to 80%<br>
self-deception. But it is a nice melody. Sigh.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#white-stripes-white-blood-cells">White Stripes: White Blood Cells</a><br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#spoon-girls-can-tell">Spoon: Girls Can Tell (Merge). </a><br>
Often a high-craft record with a lot of clever lyrics impresses but kind of leaves me cold. This one could almost do that; if I <br>
didn't like it maybe I'd say it was overdetermined. The sound (production, arrangement, everything) is quite sharp and clean <br>
(though not spare, particularly). It's all precision. The vocals are what pull this record back from the other side of iciness; <br>
they're not raw or terribly warm, exactly, but they have an authentic, mind-piercing sort of quality I find really affecting and <br>
immediate. The friend who gave me this told me that Spoon used to sound like the Pixies; I haven't heard their earlier stuff <br>
but I feel certain they're doing the right thing on this album. <br>
