Top 10 Favorites of 2001<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#plaskett-joel-emergency-down-at-khyber">1. Joel Plaskett Experience - Down At The Khyber (Brobdingnagian)</a><br>
An astounding 70's rock experience complete with Physical Graffiti style<br>
guitars and off-key vocals.  The guitar solos themselves sell the disc, and<br>
I can say that about maybe five records in my apartment.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#call-response-call-response">2. Call and Response - Call and Response (Emperor Norton/Kindercore)</a><br>
Early 60's psychedelic soul (think Friends of Distinction) melded with<br>
indie-pop sweetness.  Bouncy and beguiling, with wonderful and unexpected<br>
production touches that still astound me.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#red-house-painters-old-ramon">3. Red House Painters - Old Ramon (Sub Pop)</a><br>
I hear and understand the complaints ... repetitive arrangements, simpler<br>
lyrics, etc.  But this disc just won't leave the player.  I guess if Mark K<br>
opens his mouth it makes my top 10.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#clientele-suburban-light">4. The Clientele - Suburban Light (Merge)</a><br>
Since the US release came out in May I'll give it another nod here.  Plus,<br>
it was my favorite live performance of the year.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#toulouse-new-points-new-lines">5. Toulouse - New Points, New Lines (Grimsey)</a><br>
Melding early 80's punk (Gang of Four, Wire) with 60's French pop and a dash<br>
of new wave.  Songs about living young in an urban setting, full of bland<br>
disaffection.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#still-nectar">6. The Still - Nectar (PulCec)</a><br>
Former members of the Ropers come back with a short disc exchanging their<br>
power shoegazer past for a razor sharp pop-rock style that glimmers with<br>
precise guitars.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#kowanko-chris-spell">7. Chris Kowanko - Spell (Swimming)</a><br>
My favorite songwriter finally releases his sophomore album<br>
after 8 long years of waiting.  Reminds me of mid-80's Elvis Costello, back<br>
when he had just gone solo.  Kowanko's songs continually reveal hidden<br>
lyrical layers years later.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#avalanches-since-i-left-you">8. The Avalanches - Since I Left You (Sire/Modular)</a><br>
My natural resistance to hype was laid to waste by this sample-heavy disc<br>
filled with clever, ebullient dance-floor tunes that demand your attention.<br>
Another release that was late coming to the US.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#faint-danse-macabre">9. The Faint - Danse Macabre (Saddle Creek)</a><br>
More old school new wavey than the last one but no less enjoyable, these<br>
guys know how to craft a catchy tune and then subvert themselves in the most<br>
interesting ways.<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#bjork-vespertine">10. Bjork - Vespertine (Elektra)</a><br>
This one was slow to catch my ears but has now thoroughly won me over.  I<br>
still wish there was a little more there lyrically but am starting to wonder<br>
if perhaps that's the point ... like a gently warped fairy tale.<br>
<br>
