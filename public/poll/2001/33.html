<br>
Masterpieces from last year I didn't hear til this year (same old story):<br>
White Stripes  -  De Stilj<br>
New Pornographers  -  Mass Romantic (the best album I heard in 2001, but 6<br>
people voted for it in 2000, so I guess it's ineligible)<br>
<br>
Comments:<br>
<br>
Moldy Peaches,  <cite>The Moldy Peaches</cite> (Sanctuary)<br>
Childish, vulgar, incompetent, etc . Also, sweet, hilarious, and catchy. An<br>
emotional direct hit for me. Full of surprises.<br>
<br>
Ass Ponys,  <cite>Lohio</cite> (Checkered Past)<br>
More Cincinnati gothic. Powdered sugar trees, babies in jars, Donald<br>
Sutherland in The Day of The Locusts. Best song is "Kung Fu Reference" which<br>
taps their talent for writing really funny, really sad songs.<br>
<br>
Basement Jaxx,  <cite>Rooty</cite> (Astralwerks)<br>
Take 80's dance-pop, mix with 90's dance-pop. Add a little Prince. = Best<br>
dance-pop record of the 00's so far.<br>
<br>
Belle and Sebastian, <cite>Sing Jonathan David</cite> (Matador) <br>
I was disappointed by their full length in 2000, but here's one of two very<br>
nice EP's which could be a return to form. Best song: "Take Your Carriage<br>
Clock and Shove It". Way to go all Johnny Paycheck on us, twee kids.<br>
<br>
Clem Snide,  <cite>The Ghost of Fashion</cite> (spinArt)<br>
Despite the occasional bad jokes and feelings of smarminess, this record,<br>
like their previous outings, is full of sadness, anger, and warmth. The TV<br>
show "ED" uses "Moment in the Sun", but they cut it before Eef goes into his<br>
REALLY annoying country whine.<br>
<br>
Danielson Famile,   <cite>Fetch the Compass Kids</cite> (Secretly Canadian)<br>
They're still keeping the faith. Their records haven't been as immediately<br>
appealing of late, but sit down with this one and let their weird<br>
spirituality crawl over you. It's creepy and rewarding.<br>
<br>
Donnas,  <cite>The Donnas Turn 21</cite> (Lookout)<br>
Uh-oh, they're old enough to drink! Same basic needs: food, sex, Judas<br>
Priest. They're getting kind of annoyed with the creepy guys "three times"<br>
their age, but luckily I'm not even two times!<br>
<br>
Bob Dylan,  <cite>Love and Theft</cite> (Columbia)<br>
The old master at play. This is a sly and charming record where he channels<br>
everyone from 40's crooners to himself circa '65.<br>
<br>
Holly Golightly,  <cite>Singles Round-Up</cite> (Damaged Goods)<br>
I'm not sure if her normal full-lengths hold together but she sure can belt<br>
out catchy guitar-pop ("Virtually Happy") and has excellent taste in covers<br>
(Pavement, Lee Hazelwood and a scary Ike Turner tune).<br>
<br>
Guided By Voices,  <cite>Isolation Drills</cite> (TVT)<br>
Let's face it, they'll probably never make a record like <cite>Bee Thousand</cite><br>
again. And yes, I'd like to see Bob Pollard take a year off and see what he<br>
could come up with instead of putting out records every few hours. But this<br>
one has "Glad Girls" (holy shit that's catchy) and "Fair Touching" which<br>
approaches classic GBV in tone and "The Brides Have Hit Glass" and "How's My<br>
Drinking?" which actually make Bob sound (gulp) grown up.<br>
<br>
Handsome Family,  <cite>Twilight</cite> (Carrot Top)<br>
 I think Rennie Sparks is one of the best lyricists around. Her world is<br>
filled with birds, especially dead ones. A scary place indeed, until hubby<br>
Brett deeply intones the hymn "I Know You Are There" (although I'm not sure<br>
if it that's God he's praising) and the animals take back their world on<br>
"Peace In The Valley Once Again".<br>
<br>
The Langley Schools Music Project, <cite>Innocence and Despair</cite> (Bar/None)<br>
Hey, this band can't play either! Ok, they have an excuse. Man, I was in<br>
elementary school when this was recorded and I never had a cool teacher like<br>
Hans Fenger. I'm sure it was his idea to have all the Beach Boys songs,<br>
which perfectly suit the odd but mesmerizing arrangements. It was probably<br>
the kids' idea to have "Mandy" and "Wildfire", which are pretty good too.<br>
<br>
Stephen Malkmus,  <cite>Stephen Malkmus</cite> (Matador)<br>
Most of it sounds like Pavement which is OK by me. However, "Jo-Jo's Jacket"<br>
really indulges his odd lyrical bent and "Jenny and the Ess-Dog" showcases<br>
both his snarky humor and his sweet side which I haven't heard too much<br>
before. Nice.<br>
<br>
New Order, <cite>Get Ready</cite> (Warner Brothers)<br>
Still kinda cold, now kinda old. Guitars! Ends with an acoustic (!) ballad.<br>
A pleasant surprise.<br>
<br>
Old 97's,  <cite>Satellite Rides</cite> (Elektra/Asylum)<br>
This is pretty commercial. It's not country, it's not even alt-country. It's<br>
pop, and Rhett Miller is a very good pop songwriter. <br>
<br>
Rainer Maria,  <cite>A Better Version of Me</cite> (Polyvinyl)<br>
Pretentious, overwrought, "college-rock", fer chrissake. They're getting<br>
better, and it gets me every time in spite of myself.<br>
<br>
Various Artists, <cite>The Source Presents Hip Hop Hits Vol. 5</cite><br>
(Uptown/Universal)<br>
I bought it because my wife likes "Let Me Blow Your Mind". I've listened to<br>
it many times over the last few weeks because it's the most consistent rap<br>
album I've ever heard. It's a singles game, folks.<br>
<br>
Loudon Wainwright III,  <cite>Last Man on Earth</cite> (Red House)<br>
Old, cranky, still doubting himself. Much of it is about his Mom, and the<br>
one where he reminisces about getting drunk with her really cuts deep.<br>
<br>
White Stripes,  <cite>White Blood Cells</cite> (Sympathy for the Record Industry)<br>
Consider this also a belated vote for 2000's <cite>De Stilj</cite> a slightly better<br>
record. This one is more ambitious, but it only occasionally leads to dead<br>
spots. "Hotel Yorba" is a lot of fun and who would've thought that Jack<br>
would write the best Paul McCartney imitation of the year ("We Are Gonna Be<br>
Friends")?<br>
<br>
Lucinda Williams,  <cite>Essence</cite> (Lost Highway)<br>
Not as good as some of her previous efforts, but I cannot resist that lazy,<br>
shaky, heartbroken drawl. <br>
