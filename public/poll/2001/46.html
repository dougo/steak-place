Thoughts on my Top 10<br>
<br>
Rocket from the Crypt- Group Sounds (Vagrant)<br>
<br>
"Break dance with knives stuck in your back"<br>
<br>
Hands down -- the winner in my book.  I'll rescind my original statement <br>
that this could be their best record yet.  No, a review of their discography <br>
showed this to be their best.  Repeated listens only confirm --- this is a <br>
first-rate rock record with hooks out the wazoo, plenty of swagger, and the <br>
tightest horns they've had yet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Strike Anywhere - Change is a Sound (Jade Tree)<br>
<br>
"Inside us there's a nation hidebound and unaware....<br>
a people's insurrection of the soul to kill despair...release us now!"<br>
<br>
Maintaining a non-stop presence on the frequent listening stack here at <br>
Rockist H.Q. is the first full-length release from this Richmond, VA band.  <br>
The first thing one notices about the record is just HOW HUGE the guitars <br>
sound.  The second thing you notice is the inspired and uplifting vocals <br>
that make this an incredibly fun and empowering sing-a-long album.  Punk <br>
rock that drives musical inspiration from New York H/C of the late 80s and <br>
early 90s, the melodic H/C of bands like Lifetime, and their contemporaries <br>
Avail and Hot Water Music and lyrical inspiration from the need to live <br>
better lives than what we're handed.<br>
<br>
<br>
Pilot to Gunner - Games at High Speeds (Gern Blandsten)<br>
<br>
"We'll make the math work, if it's the last thing we do."<br>
<br>
An incredibly impressive first full-length from a relatively new band, GHS <br>
is the sound of a band well aware of its musical predecessors but sounding <br>
like no one else in particular, a band willing to push the envelope and <br>
combine tricky verses with big sounding choruses.  And they're just getting <br>
started...<br>
<br>
<br>
American Steel - Jagged Thoughts (Lookout! Records)<br>
<br>
"Light some spark in a sluggish mind.  And all the world is a powder keg<br>
I remember you loved freedom too."<br>
<br>
&gt;From my review of this album for All Music Guide: " From the opening <br>
staccato chords of Jagged Thoughts, one gets the sense that this is a giant <br>
step forward for these Berkeley punks. The one-two-three-four punk of their <br>
self-titled debut and the urgent feel of the songs on Rogue's March are <br>
still present, but they are subverted to the substantial expansion of the <br>
band's sound. Reggae and Latin-influenced rhythms mix with Clash-style <br>
anthems, raucous punk, and choruses that sounds a mile wide to form a <br>
picture of a band hitting their stride. What's more, the crisp production of <br>
Kevin Army (Green Day, Mr. T Experience) brings the gravely voices of <br>
American Steel's two singers more to the forefront than their previous <br>
releases. All of these elements serve as the backbone behind the band's <br>
knack for writing lyrics that are wistful and hopeful at the same time. A <br>
strong, strong record reflecting tremendous growth."<br>
<br>
<br>
Hot Water Music - A Flight and a Crash (Epitaph)<br>
<br>
"To know.  Know before I act, act before I grow.  In control, with fear on <br>
hold.  Cutting me loose from old rules."<br>
<br>
Hot Water Music took a giant risk in 2001 by choosing to release this album <br>
on Epitaph (which quite surprisingly alienated some of their fans) and by <br>
choosing to mix up their sound a bit.  But the variety of tempos and <br>
melodies are only a backdrop to the cohesiveness of this album and the <br>
strength of their songs, which plough deeper thoughts and more intense <br>
feelings than past releases yet somehow come across just as anthemic and <br>
powerful.<br>
<br>
<br>
National Skyline - This = Everything (File 13)<br>
<br>
An odd choice for me, only because it can hardly be called a "rock" record.  <br>
But knowing the bands (Hum, Castor, Compound Red) that these guys came from <br>
and hearing their evolution (both from their prior bands and from their EP) <br>
has to give one pause.  The soundscapes and beautiful pop that these guys <br>
create is nothing short of majestic.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fugazi - The Argument (Dischord)<br>
<br>
"memo to the partners...I'm changing all the locks...I'm pissing on your <br>
modems...I'm shredding all the stock...choose a color for your ceiling...I'm <br>
waiting for the bottom to drop"<br>
<br>
Argument may be a slightly more difficult album for people to latch onto <br>
than their previous albums, but the rewards are just as great.  Fugazi seems <br>
to have found a place that many aspire to - the two-headed beast of comfort <br>
within one's skin and a desire to push the envelope of melody and sound in <br>
new directions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Propagandhi - Today's Empires, Tomorrow's Ashes (Fat)<br>
<br>
"Conclusion:  the nail that sticks up gets hammered down..."<br>
<br>
The evolution from Less Talk, More Rock is so pronounced that this record <br>
should not be ignored.  The lyrics are likely the smartest critiques of <br>
American imperialism, misguided foreign policy, false idols, and consumerism <br>
in the realm of music and short of a Noam Chomsky work.  So intelligent they <br>
silence the critics that label "preachy" any punk rock that dares to <br>
question.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anti-Flag -  Underground Network (Fat)<br>
<br>
"They try to blind us but wee..<br>
Stand up and fight! Stand up and fight!<br>
They try to keep us ignorant but we...<br>
Stand up and fight! Stand up and fight!<br>
They want to take our rights away so...<br>
Stand up and fight! Stand up and fight!"<br>
<br>
Pittsburgh's Anti-Flag issue a call to action to the nation's youth with a <br>
series of street punk anthems in the manner of The Clash and Rancid.  The <br>
reality of post-September 11th America is the Left has been pushed out of <br>
the picture by the galvanization of the nation in our war efforts.   And it <br>
is tough to change our American policies in such a culture.  But this album <br>
serves as a potent reminder that we have to know what we're fighting for <br>
(are you so sure anymore?) and that's tough to do in the current culture.  <br>
Anti-Flag takes a stand for and against a number of different issues all of <br>
which are no less relevant today than they were in August, the over-ridding <br>
theme being the calculated disenfranchisement of a vast majority of the <br>
nation's citizens and the suppression of information need to make informed <br>
decisions.  The songs are not just blowing in the wind, however; they are <br>
grounded in information and research, the sources of which are provided <br>
throughout the liner notes.  And you can be assured, that these words are <br>
backed up by catchy melodies and razor-sharp riffs.  Extremely potent stuff <br>
here.<br>
<br>
<br>
Blueline Medic - The Apology Wars (Fueled by Ramen)<br>
<br>
"you say I have to get a real life but I'm not sure how that in making <br>
someone or other rich is any more real than making the niche for yourself"<br>
<br>
All the kids that miss the introspective lyrics and aggressive yet catchy <br>
pop-punk of Jawbreaker should sell their Jets to Brazil albums and pick up <br>
this one instead.  These guys are from Australia, but you get the sense that <br>
they've listened to their fair share of American 'college rock' (in addition <br>
to a healthy dose of The Smiths). Anchored by the incredibly intelligent, <br>
wholly self-aware, and occasionally dramatic lyrics of singer Donnie Dureau, <br>
  this is a truly terrific record.<br>
