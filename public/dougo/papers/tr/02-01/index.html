<h3>Abstract</h3>

<blockquote>This paper proposes a new model of programming, in which
the behavior of a program can be defined as separate decision point
branches.  Allowing more precise expression of the condition
determining when a branch should be chosen at a decision point leads
to better support for incremental programming.  This model can be
viewed as a fundamental mechanism underlying both OOP and AOP, which
can serve as lower-level building blocks that can be put together into
the higher-level constructs present in many AOP systems.</blockquote>
