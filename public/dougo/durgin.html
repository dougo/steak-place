    Feats: <BR>
    1st, Power Attack:
    <P>
      Prerequisite: Str 13+.<BR>
      Benefit: On the character's action, before making attack rolls
      for a round, the character may choose to subtract a number from
      all melee attack rolls and add the same number to all melee
      damage rolls. This number may not exceed the character's base
      attack bonus (+6). The penalty on attacks and bonus on damage
      applies until the character's next action.
    </P>

    bonus 1st, Improved Bull Rush:
    <P>
      Prerequisites: Str 13+, Power Attack.<BR>
      Benefit: When the character performs a bull rush, the
      character does not draw an attack of opportunity from the defender.
    </P>

    bonus 2nd, Weapon Focus (heavy flail):
    <P>
      Prerequisites: Proficient with weapon, base attack bonus +1 or
      higher.<BR>
      Benefit: The character adds +1 to all attack rolls the character
      makes using the selected weapon.
    </P>

    3rd, Cleave:
    <P>
      Prerequisites: Str 13+, Power Attack.<BR>
      Benefit: If the character deals a creature enough damage to make
      it drop (typically by dropping it to below 0 hit points, killing
      it, etc.), the character gets an immediate, extra melee attack
      against another creature in the immediate vicinity. The
      character cannot take a 5-foot step before making this extra
      attack. The extra attack is with the same weapon and at the same
      bonus as the attack that dropped the previous
      creature. <I>[Overidden by Great Cleave: The character can
	use this ability once per round.]</I>
    </P>

    bonus 5th, Sunder: 
    <P>
      Prerequisites: Str 13+, Power Attack.<BR>
      Benefit: When the character strikes at an opponent’s weapon, the
      character does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
    </P>

    6th, Power Lunge:
    <P>
      Prerequisites: base attack bonus +3, Power Attack.<BR>
      Benefit: A successful attack roll during a charge allows you to
      inflict double your normal Strength modifier in addition to the
      attack's damage.  You provoke an attack of opportunity from the
      opponent you charged.  (S&F 8)
    </P>

    bonus 6th, Weapon Specialization (heavy flail):
    <P>
      Benefit: The character adds +2 to all damage inflicted with the
      weapon the character has specialized with.
    </P>

    bonus 8th, Great Cleave:
    <P>
      Prerequisites: Str 13+, Power Attack, Cleave, base attack bonus
      +4 or higher.<BR>
      Benefit: As Cleave, except that the character has no limit to the
      number of times the character can use it per round.
    </P>

    9th, Exotic Weapon Proficiency (orc shotput):
    <P>
      Prerequisite: Base attack bonus +1 or higher.<BR>
      Benefit: The character makes attack rolls with the weapon
      normally.
    </P>

    Psychometabolism (Str)<br>
    Level: Psion 2/Psychic Warrior 2<br>
    Display: Ma<br>
    Manifestation Time: 1 action<br>
    Range: Personal<br>
    Target: You<br>
    Duration: 1 hour/level (= 9 hours) (D)<br>
    Power Points: 3<br>

    <P>
      You forge a psychometablic affinity with a chosen kind of animal 
      ("animal" is a creature type defined in the <i>Monster
      Manual</i>), from which you emulate one ability score.
    </P>
    <p>
      You can emulate only one ability score per manifestation of
      <i>animal affinity</i>, although multiple manifestations can
      affect you, as long as each emulates different ability scores.
      Any of the six ability scores can be enhanced in this fashion.
      You can increase your own ability score by a maximum of 1d4+1
      points.  Thus, if you have a Dexterity of 10, you could raise it 
      to a maximum of 15 (on a good roll).  The new ability score
      takes the place of your own for the duration of the power.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot emulate gross physical qualities such as wings,
      claws, fangs, and related anatomies, but you do take on some
      subtle characteristics of the chosen animal, at the DM's
      discretion.

    Duration: 1 minute/level = 9 minutes (D)<BR>
    Power Points: 1<BR>

    <P>
      You can constrict bleeding around wounds, lessening their impact.  You
      take a portion of any attack that deals damage as points of subdual
      damage equal to your Strength modifier (= 7).  This power is not
      retroactive to wounds received prior to manifesting <I>biofeedback</I>.

    Duration: 1 minute/level (= 9 minutes) (D)<br>
    Power Points: 3<br>

    <P>
      You can adjust your body equilibrium to correspond with any slid 
      or liquid that you stand on.  Thus, you can walk on water,
      quicksand, or even a spider's web without sinking orbreaking
      through (this does not confer any resistance to particularly
      sticky webs).  You can move at normal speed, but you cannot run
      (x3 speed) on an unfirm surface without sinking or breaking
      through.  If you fall while using this power, damage from the
      impact is halved.

    <a name="Burst">Burst</a><BR>

    <P>
      The subject receives a burst of speed.  The subject has a speed equal 
      to her original speed +10 on her next round of actions. 
    </P>
    
    <P>
      You can manifest this power instantly on yourself, quickly enough to
      gain the benefit of the speed increase in the same round.  Manifesting
      the power is a free action, like manifesting a quickened power, and it
      counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power per round.  If
      manifested on another creature, the manifestation time is 1 action.

    Power Points: 5<br>

    <P>
      Emulating the displacement ability of the displacer beast, you
      appear to be about 2 feet away from your true location.  You
      benefit from a 50% miss chance as if you had total concealment.
      However, unlike actual total concealment, <i>displacement</i>
      does not prevent enemies from targeting you normally.  <i>True
      seeing</i> reveals your true location.

    <P>
      Equipment worn or carried is also enlarged.  If insufficient room
      is available for the desired growth, you burst weak enclosures.
      However, your larger size is constrained wittout harm by stronger
      materials.  You cannot crush yourself.
    </P>
    <p>
      Your hit points, Armor Class, and base attack bonus do not
      change, but Strength increases along with size.  For every 20%
      of enlargement, you gain a +1 enlargement bonus to Strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Multiple psionic or magical effects that increase size do not
      stack.  Psionic and magical properties are not enhanced with
      this power.

    Psychometabolism (Str)<br>
    Level: Psion 1/Psychic Warrior 1<br>
    Display: Me<br>
    Manifestation Time: 1 action<br>
    Range: Personal<br>
    Target: You<br>
    Effect: 1 extra partial action<br>
    Power Points: 1<br>

    <P>
      You can take an extra partial action, but you must wait until
      your next round's worth of actions to do so.  In effect, you
      give up a standard action on the round you manifest this power,
      but gain an extra partial action on the following round.  This
      benefit counts as an enhancement bonus.

    <P>
      You can immediately apply a +1 morale bonus on a saving throw.
    </P>

    <P>
      You can manifest this power instantly on yourself, quickly enough to
      gain the +1 morale bonus on a saving throw in the same round.
      Manifesting the power is a free action, like manifesting a quickened
      power, and it counts toward the normal limit of one quickened power
      per round.
