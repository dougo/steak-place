<H3>1. Background</h3>

Text-based multi-user virtual world systems involve many natural
language processing issues.  Many of the systems accept commands in a
somewhat English-like form, and most output English text to describe
the results of the commands.  Here's a sample transcript of an
interaction with Waterpoint <a href="#Fox97">[Fox97]</a>, a MOO <a
href="#Cur97">[Cur97]</a> <a href="#Fox98">[Fox98]</a> running JHCore
<a href="#Fox98">[Fox98]</a> (user input is prefaced by ">"):

<pre>
  ><b>look</b>
  The Gull Point Lighthouse
  A basic circular room forms the main entrance and the base of the
    light tower of the lighthouse.  Some supplies are on a shelf.  The
    door out is closed. Dark stairs spiral down into the basement.  An
    old narrow ladder leads upward.  A door to the east leads to the
    house.  It is open.
  You see a games chest here.
  Gus is here, off in another world.
  ><b>look at stairs</b>
  The stairs lead down into the dark basement.
  ><b>close house door</b>
  You close the house door.
  ><b>look at chest</b>
  A wooden chest with a hinged door on top.
  Contents:
    an Auction game box
    an Abalone board
    a Rack-O! game box
  ><b>get game from chest</b>
  You haven't specified which "game" you mean.
  ><b>get abalone from chest</b>
  You remove an Abalone board from the games chest.
  ><b>give abalone to gus</b>
  You give the Abalone board to Gus.
  ><b>look at gus</b>
  Clearly, a warrior princess.  Gus wears scuba gear.
  She is awake, but has been staring off into space for 8 hours.
  Carrying:
   an Abalone board                      
  ><b>go east</b>
  You open the house door.
  The Hallway
  Worn hardwood floor and a dim ceiling light adorns this hallway in
    the old house attached to the lighthouse.  The door to the
    lighthouse tower is open.
</pre>

Some parts of this text are fixed, such as the first two sentences of
the lighthouse's description or the description of the stairs; other
parts are generated, either to describe the underlying representation
of the state of the world, such as the fact that the house door was
open and that the games chest was in the room, or to describe an event
that occurred, such as getting the Abalone board from the chest and
giving it to Gus.  Much of the generated text is done in an ad-hoc
way, however, usually involving pattern matching and replacement; for
example, the chest has a "remove" message property of the form:

<pre>
    "%Nd %n:(removes) %di from %id."
</pre>

Here, "<code>%Nd</code>" is replaced by the (capitalized) definite name of the
actor (in this case "You", since the actor is the user);
"<code>%n:(removes)</code>" is replaced by the form of the verb "removes" that
agrees with the actor (in this case "remove" to agree with "you");
"<code>%di</code>" is replaced by the indefinite form of the direct object of the
action (in this case the Abalone board); and "<code>%id</code>" is replaced by the
definite form of the indirect object of the action (the chest itself).
<p></p>
Note that this message property could actually have been much simpler:
<code><pre>
    "You remove %di from the games chest."
</pre></code>

The reason for using "<code>%id</code>" instead of "the games chest"
is for reuse: there is a generic container object that has this
message property, and all container objects inherit the property from
it (the MOO object system is object-based, rather than class-based).
So the chest object need only have a name property set on itself, and
this message (and others like it) will substitute that name into the
appropriate place.  <p></p>

The reason for using "<code>%Nd %n:(removes)</code>" instead of "You
remove", however, is more essential: since this is multi-user system,
different users see different text representations of the same events.
Thus, the user connected to the Gus character saw

<pre>
  Ragnar removes an Abalone board from the games chest.
  Ragnar gives the Abalone board to you.
  Ragnar opens the house door.
  Ragnar goes down the hallway to the east.
</pre>
The command parsing is done in a similarly ad-hoc pattern-matching
fashion; all commands must be of one of the following forms:
<pre>
    &lt;verb&gt;
    &lt;verb&gt; &lt;dobj&gt;
    &lt;verb&gt; &lt;prep&gt;
    &lt;verb&gt; &lt;prep&gt; &lt;iobj&gt;
    &lt;verb&gt; &lt;dobj&gt; &lt;prep&gt; &lt;iobj&gt;
</pre>

where &lt;dobj&gt; and &lt;iobj&gt; must refer to objects in the room
or otherwise accessible to the user's character, and &lt;prep&gt; must
be one of 28 prepositions or prepositional phrases (such as "on top
of"), grouped into 15 synonym sets; for example, "with" and "using"
are considered synonyms.  Object methods (called "verbs" for obvious
reasons) may have dobj, prep, and iobj arguments attached to them;
dobj and iobj arguments may be "this", in which case the command must
refer to the object in that position; "any", in which case the command
may refer to any object in that position; or "none", in which case the
command must not have a phrase in that position.  The prep argument
may be "any", "none", or one of the 15 preposition synonym sets.  For
example, the house door object has a method "close this none none";
the games chest object has a method "get any from this"; the Abalone
board object has a method "give this to any"; and the lighthouse room
object has methods "look none none none" and "look none at any".  The
command parser must decide from the command and the current state of
the world which method to run with which arguments; as shown above
with the command "get game from chest", if there is any ambiguity it
prints an error message and aborts.

<p></p>
<h3>2. The Task</h3>

As you can see, language processing in this system is rather
complicated yet still fairly limited.  The parser cannot understand
commands of the form "give Gus abalone board", let alone more complex
constructions such as "make Gus give abalone board to me", "put
abalone board in Auction game box in games chest", or "close games
chest then get it and give it to Gus".  And while the text generation
system tries to look nice by allowing you to specify whether a word
should use a definite or indefinite article, the use of definite
articles really ought to depend on the discourse situation.  For
example, "Ragnar gives you the Abalone board" happened to be
appropriate for Gus in this case, because she had just seen me remove
it from the chest, but if I had walked into the room carrying it and
given it to her, she should have seen "Ragnar gives you an Abalone
board".  Ideally, it would have made use of anaphora, and just said
"Ragnar removes an Abalone board from the games chest.  He gives it to
you."
<p></p>
Clearly the system needs to be more oriented towards natural language
processing and knowledge representation in order to implement these
kinds of improvements.  As I was reading about unification grammars
in <a href="#Nor92">[Nor92]</a>, I realized that since the Prolog-like
deduction system was 
inherently reversible, unification grammars could feasibly handle both
command parsing and text generation.  So, as a proof of concept, I
decided to implement a toy system involving a command parser and a
text generator to describe events to multiple users, using Norvig's
Common Lisp unification grammar system.  In particular, it should be
able to take as input:
<pre>
    command: give the book to Mary
    speaker: Fred
</pre>
and produce four descriptions of the resulting event:
<pre>
    (to Fred): You give the book to Mary.
    (to Mary): Fred gives the book to you.
    (to the book): Fred gives you to Mary.
    (to everyone else watching): Fred gives the book to Mary.
</pre>
The description from the book's perspective is perhaps irrelevant, but
in the general case, any participant is capable of observing the event
and needs to be notified-- imagine instead Fred carrying Mary and
giving her to John.  In any case, it's a simple matter for
descriptions given to inanimate objects to just be ignored.

<h3>3. The Implementation</h3>

My first attempt tried to use the full English grammar of
 <a href="#Nor92">[Nor92]</a> 
chapter 21 to parse a command into a semantic data structure and then
reverse the deduction to generate text.  However, I soon discovered
that that grammar system was not, in fact, reversible.  In particular,
the "and*" predicate was implemented with a function that assumed that
its first argument was bound; also, several rules used the "if"
predicate, which was not reversible in the "else" case because a
test involving unbound variables was always considered true, and the cut
prevented backtracking into the else clause.  The quantifier
metavariable mechanism also seemed problematic, and not necessary for
the task at hand.
<p></p>
So I moved back a few sections to 20.3, pages 694-5 in particular.
That simple grammar and lexicon had most of what I needed, and the
example even showed how it could be used to generate text, so I used
that as my starting point instead.  Here is my final grammar (to run,
replace "../paip" with the path to the paip source code directory
relative to your current directory):
<code><pre>
  (unless (boundp 'unifgram-loaded)
    (load "../paip/auxfns")
    (requires "unifgram")
    (setf unifgram-loaded t))
  (clear-db)

  ;; Declarative statement: Fred gives Mary the book.
  (rule (Statement ?pred) -->
	(NP ?agr ?subj)
	(VP (finite ?agr) ?subj ?pred))

  ;; Imperative command: Give Mary the book.  The missing subject is
  ;; "I", i.e. the speaker.  This is a little different from commands in
  ;; ordinary speech, where the subject is "you"; here, the command is
  ;; given to one's virtual self.
  (rule (Command ?pred) -->
	(VP nonfinite speaker ?pred))

  ;; Intransitive verb: [Fred] sleeps.

  ;; Ditransitive verb: [Fred] gives Mary the book.

	(NP ?any-other-agr ?goal)

		     (participant ?obj) (participant ?goal))
	(NP ?any-agr ?obj)
	(:word to)

  ;; The verb "make", in the "compel" sense:
  ;;   [Fred] makes Mary give the book to the boy.
  (rule (VP ?infl ?subj ?pred) -->
	;; Note that the object is a participant of the task, so it
	;; doesn't need to also be a participant of the "make" event.
	(Verb/make ?infl (participant ?subj) ?pred ?obj ?task)
	(NP ?any-agr ?obj)
	(VP nonfinite ?obj ?task)) 

  (rule (Verb/intr nonfinite ?x (sleep ?x)) --> (:word sleep))

  (rule (Verb/ditr (finite 3sg) ?x (give ?x ?y ?z) ?y ?z) --> (:word gives))

  (rule (Verb/trans2 nonfinite ?x (give2 ?x ?y ?z) ?y ?z) --> (:word give))

  (rule (Verb/make (finite 3sg) ?x (make ?x ?y ?z) ?y ?z) --> (:word makes))

  (rule (NP ?agr ?sem) --> (Pron ?agr ?sem))
  (rule (NP ?agr ?sem) --> (Name ?agr ?sem))
  (rule (NP ?agr (?det-sem ?noun-sem)) -->
	(Det ?agr ?det-sem)
	(Noun ?agr ?noun-sem))

  (rule (Pron ~3sg listener) --> (:word you))
  (rule (Pron ~3sg speaker) --> (:word me))

  (rule (Name 3sg (person Fred)) --> (:word Fred))
  (rule (Name 3sg (person Mary))  --> (:word Mary))

  (rule (Det ?any the)  --> (:word the))
  (rule (Det 3sg a) --> (:word a))

  (rule (Noun 3sg (young male human))           --> (:word boy))
  (rule (Noun 3sg (young female human))         --> (:word girl))
  (rule (Noun ~3sg (group (young male human)))   --> (:word boys))
  (rule (Noun ~3sg (group (young female human))) --> (:word girls))

  (rule (Noun 3sg (object ball))                   --> (:word ball))
  (rule (Noun ~3sg (group (object ball)))          --> (:word balls))
  (rule (Noun 3sg (object book))                   --> (:word book))
  (rule (Noun ~3sg (group (object book)))          --> (:word books))
</pre></code>
The main additions I made are the distinction between finite and
nonfinite verb inflections, as well as adding a VP rules for
ditransitive, transitive+to, and the "make" form with a VP
complement.  I also beefed up the semantic representation somewhat to
account for participants in events; for example, in the event
<pre>
    make(Fred, Mary, give(Mary, the(book), the(boy)))
</pre>
it's not obvious how to determine which entities are the participants
in the event-- it's not the leaves of the tree, because we want to
use "the(book)" rather than just "book" (allowing the definite
article to have some disambiguation meaning); also, "Mary" should only
be considered as a participant once, not twice.  Instead this event is
represented as
<pre>
    make(participant(Fred), Mary,
      give(participant(Mary), participant(the(book)), participant(the(boy))))
</pre>
in order to explicitly flag which objects are the participants in the
event.
<p></p>
Here is the code to process a command, given the above grammar:
<code><pre>
  ;; Process ?command, given by ?speaker, into ?desc as seen by
  ;; ?observer.  The first two arguments are inputs, and the last two
  ;; are outputs (although ?observer may also be input).  One
  ;; description will be generated for each participant, as well as a
  ;; generic third-party description.
  (<- (process-command ?command ?speaker ?observer ?desc)
      (parse-command ?command ?speaker ?event)
      (describe-event ?event ?observer ?desc))

  ;; Parse ?command given by ?speaker into a resultant ?event.
  (<- (parse-command ?command ?speaker ?event)
      (Command ?sem ?command ())
      ;; Replace 'speaker with the actual speaker object.
      (subst ?sem speaker ?speaker ?event))

  ;; Describe ?event to ?observer as ?desc.
  (<- (describe-event ?event ?observer ?desc)
      ;; For each participant in the event, recast the event with it as
      ;; the observer.
      (or (and (participant ?event ?observer)
	       ;; Replace the observer with 'listener.
	       (subst ?event ?observer listener ?subjective-event))
	  (and (or (not (participant ?event ?observer))
		   (= ?observer third-party))
	       ;; Third party description-- keep it neutral.
	       (= ?event ?subjective-event)))
      ;; Generate the description(s).
      (Statement ?subjective-event ?desc ()))

  ;; The participants of an event.  An event is a list of the form
  ;; (?action . ?rest), where ?rest is a list of either subevents or
  ;; (participant ?participant) lists.
  (<- (participant (?action (participant ?participant) . ?rest) ?participant))
  (<- (participant (?action ?subevent . ?rest) ?participant)
      (participant ?subevent ?participant))
  (<- (participant (?action ?other . ?rest) ?participant)
      (participant (?action . ?rest) ?participant))

  ;; Substitute (recursively) occurrences of ?x with ?y.  The cut is
  ;; used to ensure that *all* occurrences are replaced, not each one
  ;; separately.  e.g. (subst (a a) a x ?l) will bind ?l to (x x) once,
  ;; rather than to (x x), (x a), (a x), and (a a) in turn.
  (<- (subst ?x ?x ?y ?y))
  (<- (subst (?car . ?cdr) ?x ?y (?subst-car . ?subst-cdr))
      (subst ?car ?x ?y ?subst-car)

  (<- (or ?a ?b) (call ?a))
  (<- (or ?a ?b) (call ?b))

  (<- (and ?a ?b) (call ?a) (call ?b))

  ;; The front end.
  (defparameter speaker '(person Fred))
  (defmacro try (&rest cmd)
    `(top-level-prove '((process-command ,cmd ,speaker ?who ?desc))))
</pre></code>
Here's the system in action:
<pre>
  USER(18): (try sleep)
  ?WHO = (PERSON FRED)
  ?DESC = (YOU SLEEP);

  ?WHO = THIRD-PARTY
  ?DESC = (FRED SLEEPS);

  No.
</pre>
The symbol <code>'third-party</code> is meant to represent all observers not
participating in the event; the observer may also be specified
explicitly:
<pre>
  USER(19): USER(19): (?- (process-command (sleep) (person Fred) (person Mary) ?desc))
  ?DESC = (FRED SLEEPS);
  
  No.
</pre>
More complex examples:
<pre>
  USER(20): USER(20): (try kiss Mary)
  ?WHO = (PERSON FRED)
  ?DESC = (YOU KISS MARY);

  ?WHO = (PERSON MARY)
  ?DESC = (FRED KISSES YOU);

  ?WHO = THIRD-PARTY
  ?DESC = (FRED KISSES MARY);

  No.
  USER(21): USER(21): (try give Mary the book)
  ?WHO = (PERSON FRED)
  ?DESC = (YOU GIVE MARY THE BOOK);

  ?WHO = (THE (OBJECT BOOK))
  ?DESC = (FRED GIVES MARY YOU);

  ?WHO = (PERSON MARY)
  ?DESC = (FRED GIVES YOU THE BOOK);

  ?WHO = THIRD-PARTY
  ?DESC = (FRED GIVES MARY THE BOOK);

  No.
  USER(22): USER(22): (try give the book to Mary)

  ?DESC = (FRED GIVES YOU TO MARY);

  ?WHO = (PERSON MARY)
  ?DESC = (FRED GIVES THE BOOK TO YOU);

  ?WHO = THIRD-PARTY
  ?DESC = (FRED GIVES THE BOOK TO MARY);

  No.
  USER(23): USER(23): (try make Mary give the book to the boy)
  ?WHO = (PERSON FRED)
  ?DESC = (YOU MAKE MARY GIVE THE BOOK TO THE BOY);

  ?WHO = (PERSON MARY)
  ?DESC = (FRED MAKES YOU GIVE THE BOOK TO THE BOY);

  ?WHO = (THE (OBJECT BOOK))

  ?DESC = (FRED MAKES MARY GIVE THE BOOK TO YOU);

  ?WHO = THIRD-PARTY
  ?DESC = (FRED MAKES MARY GIVE THE BOOK TO THE BOY);

  No.

<h3>4. Other Work</h3>

The idea of using unification grammars for text generation is not new;
in fact, one of the most popular text generation systems, FUF/SURGE
<a href="#Elh97">[Elh97]</a>, is based on previous work in syntactic realization with FUGs
(functional unification grammars).  FUF is a language for writing
unification grammars, while SURGE is a large English grammar written
in FUF.  While the DCG (definite clause grammar) implementation in
<a href="#Nor92">[Nor92]</a> uses conjunctions of quantified first-order terms as its
semantic representation, FUF uses unordered sets of features, or
attribute-value pairs; these sets can be viewed as constraints.  The
input to the FUF/SURGE system is a set of constraints on what is to be
said, which is unified with the grammar, to determine how it is to be
said; this unified feature set is then sent to a linearizer which
produces the English text.  One of the main emphases of FUF, as
described in <a href="#Elh93">[Elh93]</a>, is the ability to tailor the output to the
hearer's knowledge and desire state.  While this is similar to the
multi-user virtual world situation, where we want to tailor the output
to the hearer's knowledge state and discourse history, FUF is more
concerned with resolving lexical choice directed by the speaker's
argumentative intent, i.e. choosing words that are more likely to
persuade the hearer.  It does appear to take discourse history into
account, though, so it is probably a superset of the desired
functionality.
<p></p>
Another approach to text generation system is taken in RealPro
<a href="#Lav97">[Lav97]</a>.  Unlike FUF, RealPro performs no lexical choice; its input is
a "Deep Syntactic Structure", or DSyntS, which is a fully lexicalized
dependency syntax tree, i.e. a tree of words whose arcs indicate
syntactic roles (like "subject") rather than semantic roles (like
"agent").  Rather than using unification for linearizing, it performs
more straightforward tree-structure modification, using a cascading
series of independent modules.  The system was designed to be small,
fast, and portable (available in C++ and Java), rather than having the
broad coverage and complex text planning features of FUF/SURGE;
however, its features do not at all address our task of tailoring text
output to the hearer's discourse state, so would only solve a small
part of our problem.
<p></p>
A third approach is taken by PENMAN and NIGEL (summarized in <a href="#Elh93">[Elh93]</a>;
a successor, KOMET-PENMAN(ML), is briefly described in <a
href="#Bat94">[Bat94]</a>). 
PENMAN traverses a systemic grammar (basically an annotated DAG),
choosing features for each choice point and realizing by side-effect
the detailed linguistic structure, which is then passed to NIGEL to be
realized.  The choices made encompass both discourse planning and
lexical choice, and can be the result of querying a knowledge base or
interacting with a user who is guiding the text generation manually.
This system can be thought of as the function-oriented dual to FUF's
structure-oriented system; traversal of the systemic grammar is done
procedurally, with input from the choice/query mechanism, while FUF's
search is implicit in unification and directed by the feature
structures and the declarative grammar.

<h3>5. Conclusion And Future Directions</h3>

As a toy example, this project was a sucessful proof of concept that
both command parsing and text generation for a multi-user virtual
world can be handled using a unification grammar.  However, there are
a number of improvements to be made, both small scale and large,
before this type of system could replace what is currently being
used.
<p></p>
One obvious difficulty with the current system is the need to add new
rules for every verb and object.  A more flexible lexicon system such
as the one described in sections 20.11 and 20.12 in [Nor92] would come
in handy, or perhaps a simpler system that used the local
environment of methods and objects as the lexicon.
<p></p>
Another needed feature is pronouns, including reflexives (yourself,
himself, herself).  Currently, if an event involves the same person as
subject and direct or indirect object, it looks a little funny:
<pre>
  USER(25): USER(25): (try kiss me)
  ?WHO = (PERSON FRED)
  ?DESC = (YOU KISS YOU);

  ?WHO = (PERSON FRED)
  ?DESC = (YOU KISS YOU);

  ?WHO = THIRD-PARTY
  ?DESC = (FRED KISSES FRED);

  No.
</pre>
Pronouns are also needed in sentences like "Fred makes you give Fred
the book", as well as cross-sentence anaphora in more static
texts such as room descriptions.  The problem of definite reference
also needs to be addressed, both in parsing and in generation.
<p></p>
On a larger scale, it might be possible to use FUF and SURGE directly,
in which case you get most of these kinds of things for free.
However, such a large, general-purpose system might be overkill, and
performance might become a problem.  If nothing else, it would serve
as a useful experiment and a source of ideas for how to better
represent semantic and discourse knowledge in the current system.
