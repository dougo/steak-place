<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<DIV>

DJ is a new pure-Java library for adaptive programming that allows
traversal strategies to be constructed and interpreted dynamically at
run-time, as opposed to existing adaptive programming tools that are
strictly static.  Traversal strategies can be used with adaptive
visitors (similar to the Visitor pattern) or in a generic programming
style by adapting them to the Java Collections framework.  The DJ
library makes heavy use of Java reflection and we give some details of
this implementation.

1 Introduction</A>
</H1>

<P>

<P>
Traversing complex object structures is a common operation in
object-oriented programs, yet traversal code can be tedious to write
and is often brittle with respect to an evolving object model.
<B>Adaptive programming</B> [<A
 HREF="dj.html#demeter-book">8</A>] is a development
method in which each traversal is specified succinctly as a
<B>traversal strategy</B>&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="dj.html#strategies">10</A>].  A traversal strategy
describes a traversal at a high level, only referring to the minimal
number of classes in the program's object model: the root of the
traversal, the target classes, and waypoints and constraints in
between to restrict the traversal to follow only the desired set of
paths.  The methods needed to implement a traversal can be generated
from a traversal strategy and a description of the object model,
either by hand or automatically with a tool such as
DemeterJ&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="dj.html#cse:preventive">9</A>].  If the object model changes, often
the traversal strategy doesn't need to be changed; the traversal
methods can simply be re-generated in accordance with the new model,
and the behavior can adapt to the new structure.

<P>
With the addition of reflection to Java&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="dj.html#java-reflection">5</A>], it
became possible to interpret a traversal strategy at run-time.  DJ is
a pure-Java library developed by the Demeter team that provides this
capability.  This makes it easier to add traversal strategies to a
Java program, because there is no need to modify the compilation
process to run the DemeterJ code generator or to convert the source
code to its input language syntax.  Instead traversal strategies can
simply be expressed as literal strings in ordinary Java code, or even
constructed dynamically from an external source not known at compile
time.

<P>
This paper begins by presenting an example program that uses
the DJ library, leading into
an overview of the interface of DJ.  The relation of DJ to DemeterJ is
discussed, followed by some details of the implementation, a survey of
related work, and a brief indication of future research directions.

2 Example</A>
</H1>

<P>
The example domain for this paper will be that of processing XML
Schema definitions&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="dj.html#XML-schema">3</A>].  An XML schema defines the
structure of a class of XML documents, by enumerating the element
types allowed and what attributes and subelements they may contain.
The relation between an XML schema and a conforming XML document is
analogous to an object model and a graph of instance objects.  An XML
document consists of a list of elements, each with a list of
attributes (name/value pairs) and a list of subelements (which may
themselves contain attributes and subelements).  An XML schema (which
is itself an XML document) consists of a list of type definitions and
element and attribute declarations.  A simple type definition defines a
type of attribute or element with no subelements, while a complex
type definition defines a type of element with subelements; each type
definition has a name, stored as the value of an attribute with name
<TT>name</TT>.  An element or attribute declaration has a name and a
type, stored as values of attributes with names <TT>name</TT> and
<TT>type</TT>; an element declaration may contain a local type
definition instead of a reference to a previously defined type.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="dj.html#fig:UML">1</A> shows a UML&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="dj.html#rational:UML-LUG">2</A>] class diagram
that represents a small subset of the XML Schema definition language.

A simple task that one might want to implement is checking a schema
for undefined types.  This task involves two traversals of the object
structure representing the schema definition: one to collect all the
types defined in the schema, and one to check each type referenced by
a declaration to see if it's in the set of defined types.
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="dj.html#fig:DJ">2</A> shows some definitions on the <TT>Schema</TT>
class that implement these two traversals.

<P>
The <TT>getDefinedTypeNames</TT> method collects the set of all type
definition names in a schema: it traverses the object structure rooted at
the <TT>Schema</TT> object to every <TT>Attribute</TT> object reachable
through the <TT>attrs</TT> field of a <TT>TypeDef</TT> object, and adds
the attribute value if the attribute name is <TT>"name"</TT>.  The
<TT>getUndefinedTypeNames</TT> method collects the set of all type
references which are not in the set of defined names: it traverses to
every <TT>Attribute</TT> object reachable through the <TT>attrs</TT> field
of a <TT>Decl</TT> object, and adds the attribute value if the attribute
name is <TT>"type"</TT> and the value is not the name of a defined type.

<P>
The static <TT>cg</TT> variable in Fig.&nbsp;<A HREF="dj.html#fig:DJ">2</A> is
initialized to the default class graph, which consists of all the
classes in the default package.
A <TT>ClassGraph</TT> object is a simplified representation of a UML
class diagram; its nodes are types (classes and
primitive types) and its edges are associations (has-a relations) and generalizations (is-a relations).

A traversal is performed by calling the <TT>traverse</TT> method on a
<TT>ClassGraph</TT> object.  It takes three arguments: the root of the
object structure to be traversed; a string specifying the traversal
strategy to be used; and an <B>adaptive visitor</B> object
describing what to do at points in the traversal.

<P>
A traversal strategy specifies the end points of the traversal, using
the <TT>from</TT> keyword for the source and the <TT>to</TT>
keyword for the target(s).  In between, any number of constraints can be
specified with <TT>via</TT> or <TT>bypassing</TT>.  The two
traversals in figure&nbsp;<A HREF="dj.html#fig:DJ">2</A> both traverse from <TT>Schema</TT> to
<TT>Attribute</TT>, but differ in their constraints: the first traversal
only looks at attributes of type definitions (<TT>TypeDef</TT> objects),
while the second traversal only looks at attributes of declarations
(<TT>Decl</TT> objects).  The <TT>-&gt;TypeDef,attrs,*</TT> syntax is a
pattern specifying the set of association edges in the object graph
whose source is a <TT>TypeDef</TT> object and whose label (field name)
is <TT>attrs</TT>; the asterisk means that an edge in the set can have
any target type.

<P>
Traversal strategy interpretation is done as described in
[<A
 HREF="dj.html#strategies">10</A>], with a few modifications whose details will
be presented in a future paper.  The general idea is that the object
structure is traversed recursively, but associations (including inherited
associations) which cannot possibly lead to a target object (subject to
any constraints specified in the traversal strategy) are skipped.
For example, in our XML Schema example, a
<TT>Schema</TT> object contains a collection of
<TT>SchemaItem</TT> objects; this collection may contain <TT>TypeDef</TT>
objects, since <TT>TypeDef</TT> is a subclass of <TT>SchemaItem</TT>, so
the elements of the collection are traversed as part of the
<TT>getDefinedTypes</TT> traversal.  However, some of the elements may
be <TT>AttributeDecl</TT> objects, and there is no possible path to a
<TT>TypeDef</TT> object; if one of these elements is encountered in the
collection, no further traversal of that object is performed.  The
<TT>adecls</TT> association of <TT>ComplexType</TT> is never traversed at
all, since it can only contain a collection of <TT>AttributeDecl</TT> objects.

<P>
An adaptive visitor class is a subtype of the <TT>Visitor</TT> class in
the DJ library; it implements the Adaptive Visitor pattern described
in&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="dj.html#demeter-book">8</A>, pp.&nbsp;426-427].  The Adaptive Visitor pattern
differs from the Visitor pattern as presented in&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="dj.html#gang-of-4">4</A>]
in two ways: only a minimal set of methods needs to be defined, namely
those describing the functional behavior to be performed at points
along the traversal, rather than one method each for every class in
the traversal; and no <TT>accept</TT> methods need to be defined on the
classes being traversed, nor does traversal behavior need to be
defined in the visitor methods.  These two differences result in a
unit of behavior that can adapt both to changes in the object model
and to changes in the traversal.

<P>
In place of the <TT>visitFoo</TT> methods in the Visitor pattern, an
adaptive visitor can define one or more <TT>before</TT> or <TT>after</TT>
methods, each with a single argument of the type being visited.  These
are executed at the beginning and ending, respectively, of
traversals of objects of that type.  The <TT>Visitor</TT>
subclasses defined inline in figure&nbsp;<A HREF="dj.html#fig:DJ">2</A> define one
<TT>before</TT> method each, which is executed at <TT>Attribute</TT>
objects, the end point of the traversal.

<P>
DJ also can be used with Java's Collections
framework&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="dj.html#Collections">6</A>]: the <TT>asList</TT> method on
<TT>ClassGraph</TT> makes a <TT>List</TT> from an object structure and
a traversal strategy.  The object structure is viewed as a list
of objects whose type is the target of the traversal strategy; the
list iterator performs the traversal incrementally (lazily) with each
call to <TT>next</TT> (or even backwards, with <TT>previous</TT>).
Changes to the <TT>List</TT> object ``write through'' to the object
structure.  This allows a traversal to be performed anywhere a
<TT>List</TT> is generically traversed, such as the algorithms provided
by the Collections framework like <TT>sort</TT>, <TT>reverse</TT>, or
<TT>shuffle</TT>.  

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
3 DJ and DemeterJ</A>
</H1>

<P>
The DJ library is based on DemeterJ, a development tool for adaptive
programming.  DemeterJ takes as input a <B>class dictionary file</B>,
which is a textual definition of a class diagram, along with one or
more <B>behavior files</B>, which contain method definitions.  The
methods defined in the behavior files can be plain Java methods or
<B>adaptive methods</B>; an adaptive method definition consists of a
method signature, a traversal strategy, and a set of visitor methods
to be executed during the traversal.  From these input files, DemeterJ
generates a set of plain Java files, which can then be compiled by an
ordinary Java compiler.

<P>
DJ is not meant to replace DemeterJ, but to complement it.  For those
programmers who can't or don't want to develop in a language other
than plain Java, the DJ library provides an easy way to integrate
adaptive programming into their code.  DJ also allows more flexible
dynamic traversals than DemeterJ can support, due to being able to
build class graphs and interpret traversal strategies at run-time; for
example, classes can be loaded at run-time, perhaps downloaded from the
network or constructed dynamically, and traversed using DJ.  Traversal
strategies might be defined at run-time as well, perhaps based on user
input such as a database query.  Also, this reification of adaptive
programming concepts enables the creation of more generic traversal
components with DJ: a method that performs a traversal can take as
parameters the class graph, the traversal strategy, the list of
classes to be visited, or visitor method callbacks.

<P>
However, these dynamic traversals suffer from the performance penalty
of using Java's reflection facilities.  Preliminary timing tests have
indicated that a DJ traversal runs approximately 25 to 30 times slower
than the corresponding DemeterJ traversal; however, we conjecture that
this can be improved to be only 10 times slower.  There is also the
space overhead of keeping the reified objects in memory.  The other
main advantage of using DemeterJ is that it provides more development
support by being able to automatically generate class definitions from
the class dictionary file, as well as generate utility methods for
parsing, printing, copying, and comparing object structures.  Of
course DemeterJ and DJ can be used together, since DJ is just a Java
package, adding the dynamic flexibility benefits of DJ to a regular
DemeterJ program.

<P>
Three features of DJ are new additions to adaptive programming--they
are not in DemeterJ currently but could be added.  One is the ability
to traverse classes for which the programmer does not have source
code, or is not able or willing to modify the source code; DemeterJ
only generates traversal code on the classes defined in the class
dictionary file, but it could allow traversal strategies to ``cut
across'' library packages by generating traversal code that uses the
public interface of the packages.  For example, an adaptive method
could traverse a compound GUI object made up of classes from the Swing
library.  The second is the <TT>asList</TT> method that makes a
<TT>List</TT> view of a traversal; there is no easy way to
pause an adaptive method, or go backwards, but the list iterator 
does exactly this.  Third is the ability to create a new
class graph that is a subgraph of another class graph, determined by a
traversal strategy; in essence, this allows strategies to be composed
by intersection, which is not supported in DemeterJ.  For example, if
you have a complicated strategy <TT>from A via B via
C</TT>...<TT>to Z</TT> but you want to bypass all edges named
<TT>cache</TT>, in DemeterJ you would have to add the bypassing
constraint between each pair of classes in the traversal strategy; in
DJ, you could create a new <TT>ClassGraph</TT> object from the main
class graph and the traversal strategy <TT>from * bypassing
-&gt;*,cache,* to *</TT> and then traverse that class graph using the other
traversal strategy.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
4 Implementation Details</A>
</H1>

<P>
When the <TT>ClassGraph</TT> constructor is called, it creates a graph
object containing reflective information about all the classes in a
package.

For each class in the package,
it calls <TT>Class.forName</TT> with the class name, which causes the
JVM to load the class if it hasn't already been loaded.

Once a <TT>Class</TT> object is obtained, its fields are retrieved using
<TT>getDeclaredFields</TT>; then, for each <TT>Field</TT> object, its
name and type class are retrieved using <TT>getName</TT> and
<TT>getType</TT>, respectively.  A corresponding association edge from the
defining class to the type class is then added to the graph, labeled
with the field name.  (Optionally, a class's accessor methods can be
used instead of or in addition to the fields.  This allows for
extra computation to be performed when traversing an edge, as well as
allowing ``virtual'' edges in the class graph.)  Generalization edges
are also added for each superclass and interface, retrieved from a
<TT>Class</TT> object using <TT>getSuperclasses</TT> and
<TT>getInterfaces</TT>, respectively.

<P>
The implementation of <TT>asList</TT> is somewhat trickier than regular
traversal: the list iterator must return in the middle of the
traversal whenever a target object is reached, and then resume where
it left off (perhaps going backwards) when <TT>next</TT> is called
again.  An earlier version
created an ad-hoc continuation-like object that was saved and restored
at each iteration, but this was error-prone and not very efficient;
the current version uses a separate Java thread as a coroutine,
suspending and resuming at each iteration.  An additional provided method
<TT>gather</TT> can be used to copy all the target objects into an
<TT>ArrayList</TT>, which is faster still, but the list returned by
<TT>asList</TT> has two advantages: calls to <TT>set</TT> on the
iterator can replace target objects in the original object structure,
and modifications made to the object structure while a
traversal is paused can be seen when the traversal resumes.

<P>
An Adaptive Object-Model&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="dj.html#AOM">11</A>] is an object model that is
interpreted at run-time.  If an object model is changed, the system
changes its behavior.  Java's object model can't be changed at
run-time (other than dynamic class loading) but DJ interprets the
object model when doing traversals.

<P>
DJ's <TT>Visitor</TT> class is similar to the reflective visitor
described by Blosser&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="dj.html#java-tip:reflective-visitor">1</A>] and the
<TT>Walkabout</TT> class of Jay and Palsberg&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="dj.html#palsberg:jay">7</A>], though
all three approaches were developed independently.
Blosser describes a programming technique for implementing the Visitor
pattern that uses reflection to choose which visitor method to call at
each visit in the traversal.  Jay and Palsberg improve on this by
making a single generic <TT>Walkabout</TT> class that handles the
reflective lookup and can be subclassed to provide the visitor
methods.  In addition, the <TT>Walkabout</TT> class performs the
traversal of the object structure, also using reflection.  However,
it can only traverse the entire object structure; there is no
mechanism analogous to traversal strategies for customizing the
traversal to a particular subgraph.

6 Summary and Future Work</A>
</H1>

<P>
We have presented DJ, a pure-Java library supporting dynamic adaptive
programming.    It is more flexible and
dynamic than the preprocessing approach taken by DemeterJ, by
interpreting traversal strategies at run-time and using reflection to
traverse object structures with adaptive visitors, at the expense of
performance.

<P>
The Demeter team is currently working on a number of enhancements to
DJ.  One is the ability to write visitor methods that get executed
whenever certain edges in the class graph are traversed (currently,
visitor method execution depends only on the class of the object being
traversed).  Another is the ability to write <TT>around</TT> methods on
visitors that are executed in place of a traversal step and get passed
a thunk that can be executed to continue the traversal.  Both of these
enhancements would allow visitors to have more control over the
behavior that gets executed during a traversal.

<P>

<P>
There are many optimizations that could be made to traversal
interpretation.  Some of the reflective overhead of calling
<TT>Field.get</TT> and <TT>Method.invoke</TT> could be
avoided by generating a new class (at run-time) that invokes the
appropriate fields and methods directly; although generating a class
would be a one-time performance hit, overall performance would be much
better if the same visitor and traversal strategy were used together
multiple times.  Other applications of partial evaluation to speed up
the traversal may be possible as well.

Josh Marshall designed and implemented the early versions of DJ.
Johan Ovlinger designed and implemented the predecessor to DJ, TAO
(Traversals As Objects), and suggested the run-time generation of a
class to avoid reflective overhead.  Pengcheng Wu is implementing
several enhancements to DJ, including <TT>around</TT> visitor methods
and visitor methods on edges.  Thanks to Lars Hansen for suggesting
the use of threads as coroutines for the <TT>asList</TT> iterator.  The
XML Schema example is a simplified version of an XML-Schema-to-Java
tool being developed by Adak Prasenjit.  Thanks to Erik Ostrom, Robert
Stroud, Greg Sullivan, and the anonymous reviewers, who provided many
insightful comments and suggestions.  Research supported by Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency under agreement F33615-00-C-1694
(PCES Program).
