Implementation Highlights</A>
</H1>

<P>
In this section we present some highlights of the implementation of DJ
and some examples of interesting uses.

<P>
When the <TT>ClassGraph</TT> constructor is called, it creates a graph
object containing reflective information about all the classes in a
package.  In Java, however, there is no way to get a list of all
classes in a package; packages are just namespaces, not containers.
Moreover, the JVM only knows about classes that have already been
loaded, and it only loads classes when they are referenced.  Since a
class graph might be constructed before many of the classes in
the package have been referenced, the constructor has to discover
classes some other way: it searches the class path (provided by the
JVM as <TT>System.getProperty("java.class.path")</TT>) for all
<TT>.class</TT> files in subdirectories corresponding to the package
name.  For each class file that is found, it calls
<TT>Class.forName()</TT> with the class name, which causes the JVM to
load the class if it hasn't already been loaded.  If there are
classes that need to be added to a class graph that do not exist
as <TT>.class</TT> files in the class path, for example if they are
loaded from the network or constructed dynamically, they will need to
be added explicitly by calling <TT>addClass()</TT>.

<P>
A class graph may also be created from another class graph <IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.gif"
 ALT="$G$"> and a
traversal strategy <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$S$">, forming the subgraph of classes and edges in
<IMG
 WIDTH="17" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.gif"
 ALT="$G$"> that would be traversed according to <IMG
 WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="15" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.gif"
 ALT="$S$">.  This can be used to
remove unwanted paths from a class graph, such as backlinks, rather
than having to add <TT>bypassing</TT> constraints to every traversal
strategy.

<P>
Performing traversals is done as described in
[<A
 HREF="node9.html#strategies-tr:LP97">15</A>], in a two-stage process: first, a
<B>traversal graph</B> is computed from the class graph and the
traversal strategy (which itself is converted into a <B>strategy
graph</B>, whose nodes are the classes mentioned in the traversal
strategy and whose edges each have constraints attached to that leg of
the traversal); then, the object structure is traversed, using
information from the traversal graph to decide where to go next at
each step, and visitor methods are invoked as needed.  The traversal
graph computation takes time proportional to the product of the number
of edges in the class graph and the number of edges in the strategy
graph; since the same traversal strategy is often reused multiple
times with the same class graph, the traversal graph can be saved and
reused without needing to be recomputed every time.  The class
<TT>TraversalGraph</TT> has a constructor that takes a traversal
strategy and a <TT>ClassGraph</TT> object, as well as methods
<TT>traverse</TT> and <TT>asList</TT>.  The traversal computation
algorithm is also available as a separate package, the AP Library
[<A
 HREF="node9.html#AP-Lib:99">19</A>].

<P>
At each step in a traversal, the fields and methods of the current
object, as well as methods on the visitor object, are inspected and
invoked by reflection.  Some of this reflective overhead could be
avoided by generating a new class (at run-time) that invokes the
appropriate fields and methods directly; this is planned for a future
addition to DJ.  Other applications of partial evaluation to speed up
the traversal may be possible as well.

<P>
[traversals through Object; use typed arrays instead of untyped vectors]

<P>
The implementation of <TT>asList</TT> is somewhat trickier than regular
traversal: the list iterator must return in the middle of the
traversal whenever a target object is reached, and then resume where
it left off when <TT>next</TT> is called again.  An earlier version
created an ad-hoc continuation-like object that was saved and restored
at each iteration, but this was error-prone and not very efficient;
the current version uses a separate Java thread as a coroutine,
suspending and resuming at each iteration.  An additional provided method
<TT>gather</TT> can be used to copy all the target objects into an
<TT>ArrayList</TT>, which is faster still, but the list returned by
<TT>asList</TT> has the advantage that calls to <TT>set</TT> on the
iterator can replace target objects in the original object structure.

<P>
Java's reflection system, unlike other meta-object protocols
[<A
 HREF="node9.html#AMOP">9</A>], has no mechanism for <B>intercession</B>: there is no way
to make a new subclass of <TT>Class</TT> that behaves differently for
certain meta-operations such as method invocation.  However, DJ's
<TT>Visitor</TT> class does allow a limited form of intercession.  It
has the method <TT>before(Object&nbsp;obj,&nbsp;Class&nbsp;cl)</TT> (and corresponding
<TT>after</TT>), which is invoked by the <TT>ClassGraph.traverse</TT>
method at each traversal step; it looks for a method named
<TT>before</TT> with a single parameter whose type is the class
represented by <TT>cl</TT>, and invokes it with <TT>obj</TT> as argument.
This method can be overridden by a subclass to perform more dynamic
behavior based on the reified class object of the object being
traversed.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node5.html#fig:intercession">5</A> shows a simple
pretty-printing visitor that uses this technique, along with a method
on class <TT>Schema</TT> that uses it.

<P>
Note that the <TT>XMLPrinter</TT> visitor class is generic, in that it
makes no mention of any of the XML Schema classes but is parameterized
by a mapping of classes to element names.
