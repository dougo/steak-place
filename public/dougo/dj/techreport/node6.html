<P>
DJ is closely related to DemeterJ&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node9.html#DemeterJ:00">18</A>], a preprocessing
tool that takes a <B>class dictionary file</B> (containing a textual
representation of a UML class diagram, with syntax directives for
parsing and printing object structures) and some <B>behavior files</B>
(containing regular Java methods to be attached to the classes in the
class dictionary, plus traversal method specifications, visitor
methods, and <B>adaptive methods</B> that connect a traversal with a
visitor class) and generates plain Java code for those classes with
traversal methods attached (similar to the code in
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node2.html#fig:LoD">1</A>) along with a parser and some custom visitors
such as for printing, copying, or comparing object structures.  DJ
shares the same traversal strategy language and traversal graph
algorithms as DemeterJ, but does no code generation and is a pure-Java
library.

<P>
Besides being easier to use with existing Java code, DJ has a few
other advantages compared to DemeterJ.  One is the ability to traverse
classes for which the programmer does not have source code, or is not
able or willing to modify the source code; for example, one might
traverse parts of Java's Swing library of GUI widgets.  DJ can
traverse public accessor methods, or may even use private methods and
fields if the JVM's security manager allows reflective access to
private parts (which is often the case outside of applets).  Another
feature of DJ which does not exist in DemeterJ is the ability to work
with subgraphs of a class graph; in DemeterJ, all traversals are
computed in the context of the whole class graph defined in the class
dictionary, but in DJ you can create new class graphs by selecting a
subgraph with a traversal strategy.  In addition, DJ allows components
to be more generic, by taking class graphs, traversal strategies, or
classes to be visited as run-time parameters.  These latter two
advantages are due to the reification of concepts which only exist at
compile-time in DemeterJ as first class objects in DJ.

<P>
DJ's reflective Visitor class is similar to that described in
[<A
 HREF="node9.html#java-tip:reflective-visitor">1</A>].  [more]

<P>
Java OQL, is the binding of OQL (Object Query Language) from ODMG 2.0
[<A
 HREF="node9.html#cattell:odmg2.0">3</A>] to Java, treats query specifications much like
DJ treats traversal strategy specifications.  An <TT>OQLQuery</TT>
object can be constructed from a string describing a query; the query
can then be executed by calling the <TT>execute()</TT> method on the
<TT>OQLQuery</TT> object.  Queries are either compiled dynamically at
run-time or interpreted.  An example of a query is:
<PRE>
OQLQuery query = new OQLQuery("select p.getSpouse from p in persons");
Set spouses = (Set) query.execute();
</PRE>
For an adaptive version of OQL, see&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node9.html#harrison:aql-94">6</A>].

<P>
DJ has some connections with aspect-oriented programming (AOP)
[<A
 HREF="node9.html#aop:ecoop97">10</A>].  An adaptive visitor is a specialized aspect: it
says what behavior should happen at certain principled points in the
execution of a traversal.  A traversal strategy can also be considered
an aspect: it adds crosscutting behavior whose implementation would
ordinarily require scattering methods across the class structure.
More details about the aspectual nature of DJ are in
[<A
 HREF="node9.html#aspectual-methods">11</A>].
