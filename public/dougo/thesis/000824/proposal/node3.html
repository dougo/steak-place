Evaluation</A>
</H1>
Now that I've surveyed a few existing collaborative programming
languages, I can begin identifying features that I want to keep and
features that I want to improve upon.  Of course, the general features
I identified as essential in section <A HREF="node2.html#features">2.1</A> will need to go
into my language: dynamic behavior modification, type safety, garbage
collection, multitasking, resource control, persistence, and
reflection.  I will also need to at least provide a framework in which 
security capabilities can be implemented.

<P>
The classless object-oriented model seems to be a successful one, and
my own personal bias is towards a classless object model as well; as
Abadi and Cardelli observe in their book <I>A Theory Of Objects</I> [??],
page&nbsp;36:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The main insight of object-based languages is that class-based notions 
need not be assumed, but instead can be emulated by more primitive
notions.  Moreover, these more primitive notions can be combined in
more flexible ways than in a strict class discipline.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
One of the key barriers to this sort of flexible combination in MOO,
ColdC, and LPC is the lack of garbage collection for objects.  The
ability to access any object by number (in MOO) or name (in ColdC and
LPC) leads to this restriction, which in turn has led to ad-hoc
alternative mechanisms for lightweight objects (namely waifs, frobs,
and clones) that are clumsy and limited.  A simple name-hiding
mechanism such as lexical scoping a&nbsp;la Scheme or BeCecil should solve
this problem.

<P>
The MOO server handles persistence by periodic checkpoints of the entire
database; the Genesis and DGD drivers optimize the checkpoint time by
only keeping a cache of active objects in memory, at the expense of
the extra time needed to swap inactive objects into the cache when
they are referenced.  While this tradeoff may be desirable for some
purposes, I believe that MOO's model is sufficient for most purposes:
it's the job of the operating system to provide virtual memory and
take care of swapping to and from disk, and implementing an additional 
swapping mechanism on top of this seems like diminishing returns.
More sophisticated persistence mechanisms such as journaling or
compare-and-commit might be worth investigating, but I don't consider
it an important enough issue to spend time on it for my thesis.
The issue of what to persist is another question; I think MOO has the
right idea, where everything (including tasks) is saved to disk.
ColdC and LPC allow a user to mark fields that don't need to be saved, 
but they don't save tasks.
