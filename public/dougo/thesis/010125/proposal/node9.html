Remaining Tasks</A>

<P>
The completion of the dissertation requires a number of tasks.  Its
main contribution to the field will be the BOB language as a
substantial prototype for a next-generation collaborative programming
language.  To that end, more design and implementation work needs to
be done, as well as more in-depth study and comparison of existing
collaborative languages.  My strategy for BOB is not simply to add a
bunch of features that are useful to collaborative languages, but to
add a meta-object protocol (MOP) that is powerful enough to support
implementation of all of these features as extensions to the base
language.  This has two big advantages: the base language can remain
very simple and elegant, and the various features can be implemented
several different ways in order to experiment with different design
ideas without having to change the whole language.  A particular
benefit of this latter feature is that different implementations can
exist simultaneously, so that, for example, two groups of users can
use two different security models for sharing code within each group,
and the groups can use a third security model for interacting between
groups.  My plan is to concentrate on designing a good, solid MOP, and 
to develop basic proof-of-concept implementations for the various
collaborative features without spending too much time on any one in
particular.

<P>
I don't yet have a detailed idea of how to design a MOP for BOB;
however, since BOB shares many features with CLOS, it will probably be
quite similar to CLOS's MOP.  Fortunately the design of the CLOS MOP
is described extensively in [??], so that will provide a good road
map.  The main idea is to make everything an object; currently,
generic functions are objects (which inherit from the generic function
meta-object, <TT>&lt;gf&gt;</TT>), but handlers are not yet objects.  Then,
``behind the scenes'' functions in the BOB implementation need to be
made into generic functions, so that they can be overridden by
user-defined methods.  For example, the <TT>best-handler</TT> function
chooses the most specific applicable handler from a list of handlers
and a list of arguments; if it were a generic function, then you could
attach a method that overrides the default behavior with special
behavior when the best handler happens to be owned by another user and
marked private (perhaps throwing an exception, or just ignoring it and
choosing the next best handler).
