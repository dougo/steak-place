    <HR></HR><h1>Welcome.</h1>

    <P>Hi!  My name's <a href="VitalInformation.html">Doug</a>.
      This is my page.  Stay or <a href="links.html">go</a>.
      Or visit <a href="http://steak.place.org/">The Steak Place</a>.
      Or peruse my
      <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/dougo/">journal</a>.
    </P>
    
    <P>I am a <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/gradschool/">grad student</a>
      in the <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu">Computer Science</a>
      department at <a href="http://www.neu.edu">Northeastern
      University</a>.  I plan to get a PhD before the end of 2003.
      My research interests are in the programming language field,
      especially dynamic collaborative languages (such as
      <a href="mud/">mud</a> languages).  My <a href="thesis/">thesis</a>
      is going to be about programming language support for separation 
      of concerns.
    </p>

    <p>I'm also working as a research assistant for
      <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lieber/">Prof. Karl Lieberherr</a>
      on the <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/">Demeter</a>
      project.  Mainly I do a lot of <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a>
      hacking.
      <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/mayfourteen/iwritecomp.html">I
      write computer programs all day</a>.  (Sometimes they go
      <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/january2/icomputeredit2.html">beep beep beep bonk</a>.)
      I also wrote a <a href="papers/dj/">paper about reflection in DJ</a>.
    </P>

    <p>If you're in the Boston area, you might want to come to one of several
      <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/gradschool/seminars.html">research seminars</a>
      that are held at Northeastern, or the
      <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/dynlangs/talks.htm">Dynamic 
      Languages Seminar</a> held at the AI Lab at MIT.
    </P>

    <p>I lead a
      <a href="http://calendar.yahoo.com/dougorleans">not-very-busy life</a>.
      Would you like to
      <a href="http://www.friendster.com/user.jsp?id=84026">be my friend?</a>
    </p>

    <P>I used to work at <a href="http://www.pure.com/">Pure Software</a>,
      which was <a href="http://www.rational.com/">Rational Software</a>
      for a while, which is now part of <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a>.
      I mainly worked on
      <a href="http://www.rational.com/products/purify_unix/">Purify for Solaris</a>.
    </P>

    <P>Before that I got a bachelor's degree in
      <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/">computer science</a> at
      <a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">U.C. Berkeley</a>,
      where I was a member of the
      <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/12/04/xcf/">XCF</a>
      (my project was a revamping of Brian Harvey's
      <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/">Berkeley Logo</a>
      interpreter to run as a
      <a href="http://sicp.arsdigita.org/text/sicp/section/120/">state machine</a>
      rather than a
      <a href="http://sicp.arsdigita.org/text/sicp/section/76/"> meta-circular evaluator</a>)
      and the
      <a href="http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/">CSUA</a>, where I held
      the office of
      <a href="http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/~appel/csua.html">CSUA Chauffeur</a>.
    </P>

    <P>Some of my family and their projects are on the web.  My
      stepmother co-founded the
      <a href="http://www.discoverymuseum.com/">Garden State Discovery Museum</a>,
      in <a href="http://weirdnj.com/">New Jersey</a>.
      <a href="http://www.dickorleans.com">One of my uncles</a>
      has made several recordings of 
      <a href="http://www.mtn-web.com/moon">elk bugling</a> in the Rocky
      Mountain National Park area.  He has also sent me
      <a href="pics/Uncle_Dick/">some pictures</a> he's taken with his
      digital camera.  And my
      <a href="sibs.jpg">half-siblings</a> are just very photogenic.
      Danielle (the one on the left) has
      <a href="http://www.gurlpages.com/aniangeldj/angelinx.html">her own web page</a>.
      So does <a href="http://www.geocities.com/cutbackband/">Mark's band</a>.
    </P>

    <p>I like to play games--<!-- &mdash; --> mostly
      <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/">board</a> and
      <a href="http://www.pagat.com/">card games</a>, but I
      also sometimes play <a href="http://wizards.com/dnd/">D&amp;D</a>.
      I was also in a <a href="http://l5r.alderac.com/">L5R CCG</a>
      tournament a few years ago but I haven't really played since.  I 
      dabble in game design, especially using
      <a href="http://steak.place.org/games/aquarius/">the Aquarius deck</a>.
      I also implemented
      <a href="http://steak.place.org/servlets/chessmaze.scm">a chess maze</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I recently got a
      <a href="http://www.powershot.com/powershot2/s330/">digital camera</a>,
      and have been taking a lot of
      <a href="pics/games/">pictures of games</a>.
      Before that, I had been taking
      <a href="scanned/photos/110/">photos</a> with
      <a href="http://www.dyson.brisnet.org.au/~craig/autopak460t.jpg">an
	old 110 camera</a>.  A bunch of them are
      <a href="pics/">somewhat disorganized</a>.  I submitted two of
      them to <a href="mirrorproject/">The Mirror Project</a>.
    </P>

    <P>I like <a href="http://www.cdnow.com/taf_gift/dougo@ccs.neu.edu">music</a>.
      I conducted <a href="poll/">a few music polls</a>.  
    </P>

    <p>Are the things on this site of value to you?  Why not
      <a href="donate.html">compensate me</a> for them?
    </p>

    <P>I've made some <A HREF="tapes/">mix tapes</A> of music I like.
    </P>

    <P><a href="http://www.dsl.org/m/">Michael Stutz</a> has recently
      unearthed the <a href="grunge.tar.gz">GRUNGE-L archive</a>,
      chronicling the bumper years of the GRUNGE-L discussion list,
      1990-1994.  For most of that time, it was the most intelligent,
      well-spoken, and informative email list I knew of, despite it
      being about some of the most inarticulate, messy, and (usually)
      <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Towers/5752/Melvins/houdini_lyr.html">rock-stupid</a>
      music ever produced.  The list discussion was also uproariously
      funny and full of friendly banter and very few flames or hard
      feelings.  Ahh, those were the days... </p>

    <P>Check out this freaky

    <p>SF author
      <a href="http://cryptonomicon.com/author.html">Neal Stephenson</a>
      wrote an interesting essay called
      <a href="http://cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html">In the Beginning was the Command Line</a> 
      about the operating system wars, but his web site removed the
      HTML version and now only provides a badly formatted flat-text
      version for download; fortunately, I kept a
      <a href="inthebeginning.html">copy of the original</a>.
