<h2>How to compile and run Java programs at CCS</h2>
On Solaris, at CCS:

<P>
To compile:

<PRE>
jikes -classpath $CLASSPATH\:$JIKESPATH -d . -g +E *.java
</PRE>

(where JIKESPATH has the Java system classes,
currently /arch/unix/packages/j2sdk1_3_0beta/jre/lib/rt.jar on Solaris).  
You have to introduce an environment variable JIKESPATH,
for example in your .software file. I use:

<PRE>
JAVA_HOME=/arch/unix/packages/j2sdk1_3_0beta
# Location of JDK libs, for the Jikes compiler
JIKESPATH=$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/rt.jar
</PRE>
in my .software file.  (The Java 2 SDK should already be in your path,
if you have e.g. "@all" or "@gnu-all" in your .software file; use

<PRE>
which java
</PRE>

to find out where the current version is.)

<P>
The +E gives error
messages in a format that Emacs can parse.  "jikes -help" shows all
the available options.

<P> jikes is at:

<PRE>
/arch/com/bin/jikes
</PRE>
An alternative to jikes is to use javac from the Java 2 SDK.
Why should you use jikes over javac? jikes gives you better error messages
and it compiles much faster. 

<P>
To run:<br>
<PRE>
java Main
</PRE>
provided Main contains the main() method.

<P>
To get jikes for your machine, use:

">Jikes compiler home page.</a>

<h2> Compiling Java files that have been created by Demeter/Java. </h2>

In some homeworks you get generated Java files to take the tedious
work from you. The Java files live in a directory that has
usually the name gen.
<A HREF="
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/DemeterJava/quick-help/TABLE-OF-CONTENTS.txt
">Contents of generated java code.</A>

<P>
To compile and run the provided Java classes, you need to put
the file at
<A HREF="
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/DemeterJava/rt.jar
">http://www.ccs.neu.edu/research/demeter/DemeterJava/rt.jar</A>
into your CLASSPATH.
This jar file contains the runtime support package
(edu.neu.ccs.demeter.*), as well as DJ (edu.neu.ccs.demeter.dj.*)
and the AP Library (edu.neu.ccs.demeter.aplib.*,
edu.neu.ccs.demeter.aplib.cd.*, and edu.neu.ccs.demeter.aplib.sg.*).

<P>
The same file is also at: /proj/demsys/demjava/rt.jar
for users of CCS Solaris machines.

To compile them, use:

<PRE>
jikes -classpath $CLASSPATH\:$JIKESPATH -g *.java
</PRE>

If you prefer to use javac, you can simply use:

<PRE>
javac *.java
</PRE>


To run the program, use:

<PRE>
java Main < program.input
</PRE>
where program.input contains an object description
that is given as input to your Java program.
Study class Main.java to see how the parser is invoked.


<h2> Using jikes to compile Demeter/Java programs</h2>

You need to add $JIKESPATH to your CLASSPATH environment variable when 
running demjava:

<P>
In one command, in csh or tcsh,

<PRE>
    env CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH\:$JIKESPATH demjava MODULENAME
</PRE>

    This is equivalent to, in sh, ksh, or bash,

<PRE>
    CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$JIKESPATH demjava MODULENAME
</PRE>
where MODULENAME is one of the allowed modules, e.g. test, new, etc.
Run demjava -help to see all possible module names.

In the *.prj file it is recommended that you use

<PRE>
// Java compiler arguments.
COMPILE_ARGS =  -g -depend +E
</PRE>

for the compiler arguments.

<P>
From Doug Orleans:
The crux of the matter is that jikes needs the Java library classes to
be on the classpath, and the way it handles its own JIKESPATH variable
is sort of strange (it doesn't add JIKESPATH to the CLASSPATH, it
uses one or the other but not both).  But I didn't feel comfortable
just putting jre/lib/rt.jar in my CLASSPATH permanently,
because Java doesn't need it.  So I do it as I've described.  Your
mileage may vary.
