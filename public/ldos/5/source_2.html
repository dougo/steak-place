Up with the sun, you went out to the bog, filled a big basket with cranberries, and started for town.  Dad had brought you along many times before on his trips to the market to sell his harvest to the greengrocer, but you're old enough now to go by yourself.  Dad and Mom will be so proud when you return to the hut with a pocket full of money!</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">You made your way through the fields on the outskirts of town, a cool but gentle breeze blowing through your hair.  The cloudless sky showed no sign of the huge storm that passed through a few days ago, but when you got to the river you found the mark it left: the splintered remains of the wooden bridge that the flood swept away.  Great, now how are you going to cross the river to get into town?</span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote"></span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">It's the last day of summer, and the sun shines bright and beautiful.  No sense in turning back so soon.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0"></p><p class="indent0">The time of day is 10 AM.</p><p class="indent0"></p>
