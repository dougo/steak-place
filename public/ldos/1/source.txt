Part - Notes

[
Specification (from Zarf):

* Game D: (Sunny town. Also a building site, with building stones piled around.)

You find a rusty knife, which you use to cut some stuff. You also come across a sundial, and (in the spirit of Trinity) unscrew the gnomon -- it's a repurposed brass key which you need. You then meet a man who wants the knife. In return, he gives you his hat, which you need to disguise your face for some reason or other.

Somewhere in this town, you come across a legend: a man who has stolen the treasure of time. Even worse, he then lost it. He is cursed to wander until he finds it again, and replaces it on the altar he stole it from.

(Later: So maybe just add a legend, or a legend element, that the treasure was split into two pieces which must be reunited?)

The rusty knife in game D is the magic knife in game C.
If you unscrew the sundial gnomon and stick the knife in it, the shadow
points at a specific time.  The magic time is 9:37.

The hat has no specific physical description, but the protagonist in game D finds it surprising.
The man is also vaguely described, but is unshaven.

Part - The Beginning

When play begins:
	say "Today started out so well.  Up with the sun, you went out to the bog, filled a big basket with cranberries, and started for town.  Dad had brought you along many times before on his trips to the market to sell his harvest to the greengrocer, but you're old enough now to go by yourself.  Dad and Mom will be so proud when you return to the hut with a pocket full of money!

You made your way through the fields on the outskirts of town, a cool but gentle breeze blowing through your hair.  The cloudless sky showed no sign of the huge storm that passed through a few days ago, but when you got to the river you found the mark it left: the splintered remains of the wooden bridge that the flood swept away.  Great, now how are you going to cross the river to get into town?

It's the last day of summer, and the sun shines bright and beautiful.  No sense in turning back so soon."

He is cursed to wander until he finds the pieces again, reunites them, and replaces it on the altar he stole it from.'  The greengrocer chuckles, then goes quiet again.

The greengrocer takes the book in his hands, holding it like a treasure.  Tears start to fill his eyes as he pages through it.

He looks up at you, astonished and grateful.  'Tolmy, I[--] I don't know what to say.  I never knew...  Preacher must have been working on this book for years, but he never spoke a word about it to me.  Or anyone, I imagine.'

The greengrocer goes back to reading for a moment, then stops, closes the book, and stands up.  'Come with me.'

You follow him outside and through the town, until he stops at a house near the market.  'Wait here,' he says, as he disappears inside, returning a minute later.  'Young Master Cubbins, you have done me[--]and the world![no line break][--]a great service today, finding Preacher's life's work.  His words will live forever, now.  Please accept this reward, as a small part of the thanks I owe you.'  He hands you a velvet purse, heavy with clinking coins.  That's more than a whole season's harvest worth of cranberries!

The greengrocer bows to you, and you return the bow, clumsily but earnestly.  He smiles, and says, 'Say hello to your dad for me.'  Patting you on the shoulder, he sends you on your way back home.";

[paragraph break]  sitting beside the greengrocer?
[line break]  reading the book?
[line break]  leaving the knife somewhere?
[line break]  replacing the gnomon?
[line break]  feathering your hat?
[line break]  waiting for the sun to go down?"
