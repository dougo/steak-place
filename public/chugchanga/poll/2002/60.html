Erm, make that sleeping and working. I didn't buy much (see entry #2), so I haven't put the top 20. Just the ones I developed a colossal attachment to.
</p><ol><li><a name="hives__veni_vidi_vicious" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#hives__veni_vidi_vicious"><strong>The Hives</strong>, <cite>Veni Vidi Vicious</cite> (Reprise)</a><br />It's been said.<br /><br /></li><li><a name="princess_superstar__princess_superstar_is" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#princess_superstar__princess_superstar_is"><strong>Princess Superstar</strong>, <cite>Princess Superstar Is</cite> (Rapster)</a><br />There's a reason why 'Bad Babysitter' sticks with me, and it's not just the line 'making six bucks an hour'. Though that is approximately what I make. It's milk-spraying clever, like most of this album. The music's more catchy than anything, but it most certainly doesn't suck. No indeedy.<br /><br /></li><li><a name="streets__original_pirate_material" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#streets__original_pirate_material"><strong>The Streets</strong>, <cite>Original Pirate Material</cite> (Atlantic)</a><br />The Beastie Boys. Princess Superstar. Foreskin 500. Jon Spencer. Eminem. Joan Osborne and Toni Childs for godssake. And now the Streets. It's probably time I examined my taste for black forms chiefly when they're interpreted by white people. I won't do that here though.<br /><br /></li><li><a name="apples_in_stereo__velocity_of_sound" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#apples_in_stereo__velocity_of_sound"><strong>Apples in Stereo</strong>, <cite>Velocity of Sound</cite> (spinART)</a><br />Bittersweet bubblegum; works like a charm for the whole family.<br /><br /></li><li><a name="mclusky__mclusky_do_dallas" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#mclusky__mclusky_do_dallas"><strong>McLusky</strong>, <cite>McLusky Do Dallas</cite> (Too Pure)</a><br />More funny lyrics, in fact the best of the year: 'My love is bigger than your love, we do more drugs than a touring funk band, sing it!' This record is a bucket of blood.<br /><br /></li><li><a name="sadies__stories_often_told" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#sadies__stories_often_told"><strong>The Sadies</strong>, <cite>Stories Often Told</cite> (Yep Roc)</a><br />Toronto country-and-western, emphasis on the Western, as sung by an undertaker-manqu&eacute; and filtered through a cannabis fug. Goes great with Deadbolt, Johnny Cash, smoky tea and melancholy. If I lived in Bacon Strip, Manitoba, this would never leave my turntable.<br /><br /></li><li><a name="piebald__we_are_the_only_friends_we_have" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#piebald__we_are_the_only_friends_we_have"><strong>Piebald</strong>, <cite>We Are the Only Friends We Have</cite> (Big Wheel Recreation)</a><br />This record reminds me of my favorite couplet from the Australian picture _The Bank_: Boy meets girl. They race home and tear each other's clothes off. Boy: Shouldn't we get to know each other first? Girl: What if we don't like each other? This record is like that line: Practical, witty, direct, healthy, yearning, a bit frenzied, generous. It opens a door I want to step through.<br /><br /></li><li><a name="sahara_hotnights__jennie_bomb" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#sahara_hotnights__jennie_bomb"><strong>Sahara Hotnights</strong>, <cite>Jennie Bomb</cite> (Jetset)</a><br />After I bought this and played it a million times, trying to remember precisely what memories it was evoking, I read a review comparing these Swedes to Pat Benatar. Queasily, I felt the jolt of recognition. Moments later I decided: Pat Benatar is underrated.<br /><br /></li><li><a name="interpol__turn_on_the_bright_lights" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#interpol__turn_on_the_bright_lights"><strong>Interpol</strong>, <cite>Turn On the Bright Lights</cite> (Matador)</a><br />Yeah okay already; we know what you all hate about this record. Just shut up and let the few of us who love it lean in close and weep in peace.<br /><br /></li><li><a name="queens_of_the_stone_age__songs_for_the_deaf" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#queens_of_the_stone_age__songs_for_the_deaf"><strong>Queens of the Stone Age</strong>, <cite>Songs for the Deaf</cite> (Interscope)</a><br />Can't write anymore!</li></ol><p /><hr /><a href="68.html">prev</a> | <a href="voters.html">list</a> | <a href="55.html">next</a></body></html>
