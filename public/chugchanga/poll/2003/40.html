Wonderful guitar work, and a (slight) step away from the more literal story-songs of the Red House Painters.</li><li><a name="381"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#381"><strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong> <cite>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</cite> (Rough Trade)</a><br />An undeniable return to greatness from the best pop band of the 90's.  Trevor Horn's production adds a consistency that their post-Sinister efforts have lacked.  The multitude of genre exercises from new wave to soul to glam are all winners.</li><li><a name="53"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#53"><strong>The Clientele</strong> <cite>The Violet Hour</cite> (Merge)</a><br />Continues their formula of gauzy music, breathy vocals and blurry lyrics.  "The House Always Wins" is their 8+ minute centerpiece, promoting a feeling of escape punctuated with a sterling guitar solo.</li><li><a name="638"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#638"><strong>My Favorite</strong> <cite>The Happiest Days Of Our Lives</cite> (Double Agent)</a><br />If you're as much of a soft touch for morose 80's pop as I am and you don't own a My Favorite release yet, now is the time to rectify that gaping chasm in your collection!  The combination of three outstanding ep's combined with four new songs and a discload of remixes make this an unbeatable bargain.  Donnie Darko fans unite!</li><li><a name="639"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#639"><strong>Ween</strong> <cite>Quebec</cite> (Sanctuary)</a><br />Continues the theme of the previous two albums by intermingling reverent parodies of 70's musical genres and jaw-dropping guitar work.  My only complaint is the solos aren't nearly long enough.  They can jump from Zappa to Motorhead to prog and nail each one with a perfection that serious-minded mimickers only dream of approaching.</li><li><a name="315"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#315"><strong>British Sea Power</strong> <cite>The Decline Of British Sea Power</cite> (Rough Trade)</a><br />If their best days are behind them as the title implies, then I wish I knew of them earlier in their career.  Taking a page from unhinged 80's rock (think Birthday Party) and smoothing it out for the new century, this disc features recklessly emotional vocals and unleashed playing.  If not for two 10+ minute dirges it could've been my #1.</li><li><a name="640"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#640"><strong>Kaada</strong> <cite>Thank You For Giving Me Your Valuable Time</cite> (Ipecac)</a><br />I'm a sucker for a well-placed sample in the context of a traditional song and this album is chock full of 'em.  Not a pastiche like the Avalanches, but the songs are heavily influenced by various 60's and 70's era swipes.  Originally released in Norway a couple years ago, it was released to the US in 2003.</li><li><a name="641"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#641"><strong>Radio Dept.</strong> <cite>Lesser Matters</cite> (Shelflife)</a><br />Not your typical Swedish pop band.  Their aspirations are grounded in early 90's fuzzpop with heavily obscured vocals and overmodulated instruments.  That doesn't mask the lyrical power of many of these tunes.</li><li><a name="221"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#221"><strong>Alaisdar Roberts</strong> <cite>Farewell Sorrow</cite> (Drag City)</a><br />A dead-on late 60's/early 70's British folk knock-off, my favorite elements of this disc are the loose out-of-sequence story formed by the songs and the consistency of his beloved's name in each one.  Viscerally paints a portrait of some long bygone era of rural British life and keeps it imprecise enough to warrant continued exploration</li><li><a name="252"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#252"><strong>Pernice Brothers</strong> <cite>Yours, Mine and Ours</cite> (Ashmont)</a><br />Took a little bit longer than normal to warm up to the latest Pernice Brothers outing but when the quality finally shone through it lifted this one up amongst its predecessors.  Some of the 80's swipes are more obvious, but no less enjoyable.</li><li><a name="642"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#642"><strong>Zongamin</strong> <cite>Zongamin</cite> (XL/Flesh)</a><br />An all-instrumental disc with a great mix of styles, including funk, disco, choppy new wave and what seems to be a call for breakdancing.  Each tune shines within its genre and grabs hold without getting too repetitive.</li><li><a name="643"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#643"><strong>The Innocence Mission</strong> <cite>Befriended</cite> (Badman)</a><br />How many albums did we have to endure this year featuring the hip new concept of married couples making music together?  These two have been creating blissful folk-pop for over ten years now, and this album continues their winning mixture of gorgeous guitar work and heavenly vocals.</li><li><a name="644"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#644"><strong>Wheat</strong> <cite>Per Second, Per Second, Per Second ... Every Second</cite> (Aware/Columbia)</a><br />Saddled with perhaps the lousiest album title this year, Wheat's bid for the mainstream smartly polishes their sound without alienating the old fans.  Fridmann's production can often be too busy for me, but here it's restrained enough to compliment the songs without overwhelming them.</li><li><a name="128"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#128"><strong>The Sprites</strong> <cite>Starling, Spiders, Tiger and Sprites</cite> (March)</a><br />I questioned Jason Korzen's sanity for disbanding his wonderful new wave group Barcelona, but he's rewarded us with this wonderful new concern.  It has a very Lucksmiths feel to it, but trades clever wordplay for sentimental sincerity.  That's an improvement in my mind.</li><li><a name="280"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#280"><strong>The Decemberists</strong> <cite>Castaways And Cutouts</cite> (Kill Rock Stars)</a><br />The Decemberists had two 2003 releases this year, but I'm selecting this 2002 re-issue of their debut for my list. Contains what could be my favorite line of the year, "I figured I'd paid my debt to society/by paying my overdue fines at the Multnomah county library"</li><li><a name="313"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#313"><strong>Sloan</strong> <cite>Action Pact</cite> (ViK)</a><br />OK, it's not their best album.  It's probably not even mid-pack.  But it contains one of their finest songs ever "False Alarm" plus several more that back it up strongly.  And that's good enough in my book for a spot in the top 20.</li><li><a name="125"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#125"><strong>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</strong> <cite>Fever To Tell</cite> (Interscope)</a><br />A bit of a disappointment considering how strong their ep was, but still more than engaging enough to include on the list.  The songs are far too underwritten but Karen pulls off a decent portion of them, including the year's best ballad, "Maps."</li><li><a name="645"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#645"><strong>Ronderlin</strong> <cite>Wave Another Day Goodbye</cite> (Hidden Agenda)</a><br />A traditional Swedish pop band that staved off my jones for a new Eggstone release, at least for another year.  Wonderful touches abound, including some nice horns, keyboards and equal dashes of the Beatles and the Smiths.</li><li><a name="32"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#32"><strong>Owl &amp; The Pussycat</strong> <cite>Owl &amp; The Pussycat</cite> (Kill Rock Stars)</a><br />Lois Maffeo teamed up with 70's retro-popper Greg Moore to create simple and catchy slices of indie-pop for our enjoyment.  Lois can carry the disc on her voice alone, but when lent to such lovely songs it's difficult to resist.</li><li><a name="646"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#646"><strong>Bishop Allen</strong> <cite>Charm School</cite> (Self-released)</a><br />Former Boston area lo-fi punkers go to college, find a few female bandmates, and morph into a cheery little pop outfit.  It's impossible to stifle the desire to clap along and tap your tones to the outlandishly catchy but simply constructed tunes.</li></ol><p></p><hr /><a href="39.html">prev</a> | <a href="voters.html">list</a> | <a href="41.html">next</a></body></html>
