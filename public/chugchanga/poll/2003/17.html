I didn't dislike them before this record, I just never cared enouch to pick up a record. It trails off near the end, but what a fun summer record this was.</li><li><a name="248"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#248"><strong>Crooked Fingers</strong> <cite>Red Devil Dawn</cite> (Merge)</a><br />Don't really care about Archers of Loaf. Saw these guys live and it all clicked. Some bands you just gotta see live to get.</li><li><a name="161"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#161"><strong>Silkworm</strong> <cite>You Are Dignified</cite> (Touch &amp; Go)</a><br />Not originals, but good enough to hold me over until a proper Silkworm release this year. Got me off my butt to check out some records I had missed and revisit some dusties. Who kew you could shred on a mandolin? However I still don't get Nina Natasha.</li><li><a name="263"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#263"><strong>Pinebender</strong> <cite>The High Price Of Living Too Long With A Single Dream</cite> (Lovitt)</a><br />They like the long dramatic album title but don't hold that against them. Nn retro good angular rock that swings. Great trio rock made even great when you realize they lost their amazing barefoot baritone guitar player and then they regroup by bringing the drummer upstage to take over that role and pulling in a new drummer.</li><li><a name="264"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#264"><strong>Sentridoh</strong> <cite>Loobiecore</cite> (Loobiecore)</a><br />Really just an excuse to point out that Lou barlow has put up some great songs in the MP3 format on his iste and they're worth checking out. I love it when free MP3s are better than "real" records. Man, I listen to a lot of acoustic stuff in 03, or at least the only new stuff I like was acoustic.</li><li><a name="265"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#265"><strong>Consonant</strong> <cite>Love and Affliction</cite> (Fenway)</a><br />Not as good as sseing Clint do solo stuff at the Middle East live but a nice batch of songs to hold me over until the Burma record.</li><li><a name="266"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#266"><strong>Sleater Kinney</strong> <cite>One Beat</cite> (KRS)</a><br />never liked their other stuff until this. OHHWAYYOHHWAHOH.</li><li><a name="115"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#115"><strong>Rye Coalition</strong> <cite>Jersey Girls EP</cite> (tigerstyle)</a><br />Ahh this balances out some of the acoustic goodnees from 2003. Not profound but rockin' with little or no pretense. Closest thing I've heard to the Jesus Lizard in long time, but with the classic rock influence up out in front.</li><li><a name="78"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#78"><strong>Grandaddy</strong> <cite>Sumday</cite> (V2?)</a><br />Earcandy, but pretty good ear candy.  Another summer record. Again never liked them until this. A  common theme this year.</li><li><a name="267"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#267"><strong>Alaska!</strong> <cite>Emotions</cite> (b-girl)</a><br />http://www.inmusicwetrust.com/articles/56r03.html
Pretty fun rock record heading into Neil Youngish territory.  I don't know if they stayed together or if they're still playing out but the guitarist is one of the most wild physical players I've seen outside of yr standard noise or super fast core band...</li><li><a name="268"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#268"><strong>The ROOTs</strong> <cite>Phrenology</cite> (MCA)</a></li></ol><p></p><hr /><a href="16.html">prev</a> | <a href="voters.html">list</a> | <a href="18.html">next</a></body></html>
