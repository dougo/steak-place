I'll hear them someday.</p><ol><li><a name="426"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#426"><strong>Animal Collective</strong> <cite>Campfire Songs</cite> (Catsup Plate)</a><br />An extraordinarily beautiful record.  I'd like to go live in it.</li><li><a name="47"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#47"><strong>Animal Collective</strong> <cite>Here Comes The Indian</cite> (Paw-Tracks)</a><br />An extraordinarily beautiful record.  It'd be tougher to live in this one.</li><li><a name="427"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#427"><strong>Supersilent</strong> <cite>6</cite> (Rune Grammofon)</a><br />In much the same way that bands like Animal Collective, Black Dice, Boredoms, etc. have reanimated the dead form of psychedelic music, Supersilent has reanimated the dead form of free jazz.  Utterly incredible.</li><li><a name="428"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#428"><strong>Curtains/Natural Dreamers/Deerhoof</strong> <cite>Flybys/s-t/Apple O'</cite> (Thin Wrist/Frenetic/5RC-KRS)</a><br />Chris Cohen, Greg Saunier, and John Dietriech had large hands in all 3 of these records, and a certain aesthetic/universe is present in each of them, so I will lump them together in a ball of greatness.  
Curtains make a very curious, alive brand of skewed instrumental clattering music.  It's not too good when the drummer does Gastr del Sol-ish poetic vocalizings, so luckily it doesn't happen to often.  Natural Dreamers are just about the best post-Magic Band gtr majesty I've heard.  Deerhoof you know.</li><li><a name="429"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#429"><strong>Double Leopards</strong> <cite>Halve Maen</cite> (Eclipse)</a><br />A dense, dizzying double album of a most higher-mindedness.  The side-long "A Hemisphere In Your Hair" is "song" of the year.  Ed Hardy of Eclipse is kicking my ass, and doing it from Bullhead City, AZ.</li><li><a name="119"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#119"><strong>Sightings</strong> <cite>Absolutes</cite> (Load)</a><br />I truly love the blown-out sound of this record.</li><li><a name="133"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#133"><strong>Erase Errata</strong> <cite>At Crystal Palace</cite> (Troubleman)</a><br />Arguably the best rhythm section around.  I forget if they had a backlash this year or not.</li><li><a name="430"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#430"><strong>No Neck Blues Band</strong> <cite>Ever Borneo</cite> (Sound @ 1)</a><br />Like all the greatest bands, they conjure up a world worth living in.</li><li><a name="431"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#431"><strong>Scott Tuma</strong> <cite>The River</cite></a><br />The soundtrack to the movie of the few truly deep, ineffable, quiet moments of yr life.</li><li><a name="62"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#62"><strong>Lightning Bolt</strong> <cite>Wonderful Rainbow</cite> (Load)</a><br />Sure, sure.</li><li><a name="432"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#432"><strong>U.S. Maple</strong> <cite>Purple On Time.</cite> (Drag City)</a><br />This one leaves them clinging to the top of the heap.  Like w/one finger.</li></ol><p></p><hr /><a href="30.html">prev</a> | <a href="voters.html">list</a> | <a href="32.html">next</a></body></html>
