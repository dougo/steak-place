Guitars, bass and drums. I don't mind keyboards, but have little to no interest in electronic or digitally based music. 3 to 5 people playing real instruments together in a room is where it's at for me. Aside from #1, no particular order. I buy vinyl whenever possible, so cd versions of some of these may be on different labels.</p><ol><li><a name="230"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#230"><strong>Bettie Serveert</strong> <cite>Log 22</cite> (Waaghal's (Netherlands))</a><br />Their best to date. Wide variety of material, 85% of it good, even including the Velvets style raveups. At least half of these songs should have been hits.</li><li><a name="231"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#231"><strong>Brant Bjork</strong> <cite>Keep Your Cool</cite> (Duna)</a><br />Best quote (at an in-store show in StL to a Vintage Vinyl employee): "Don't worry, we won't be loud. We're way too high to play loud." Simple, groovy rock, more of a vibe thing than song oriented. Bjork really swings on the drums.</li><li><a name="232"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#232"><strong>Nebula</strong> <cite>Atomic Ritual</cite> (Liquor &amp; Poker)</a><br />If you like guitar solos, get this album. Their best yet.</li><li><a name="22"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#22"><strong>Constantines</strong> <cite>Shine a Light</cite> (Sub Pop)</a><br />Compared to the live set, a bit of a let down, but still good. They've got soul AND balls. Occasional singer #2 should remain quiet. Amazing live band, totally blew me away. The last time I was this impressed by a live set was Sonic Youth '85. The "Springsteen fronting Fugazi" description is actually not that far off, but only if Bruce's voice were more roached and Fugazi had a little 60s r&amp;b influence.</li><li><a name="233"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#233"><strong>Back in Spades</strong> <cite>The Time Is Now</cite> (self-released)</a><br />The publicity pitch would be Fred 'Sonic' Smith's kid as one of the guitarists here, but the whole band rocks and the songwriting is strong. Nice version of Dad's "City Slang." Wipes the floor with just about all Detroit-influenced rock of the past decade or two. It seems the only place to buy it is at a show or through recordsnyc.com (Subterranean)</li><li><a name="88"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#88"><strong>The Darkness</strong> <cite>Permission to Land</cite> (Atlantic)</a><br />It's fucking great, even the ballads.</li><li><a name="234"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#234"><strong>Wire</strong> <cite>PF456REDUX</cite> (Pink Flag (UK))</a><br />Pulls together edited versions from both Send and the two eps. Pro-tooled elements go down easy since Gotobed's playing emulates machinery in the first place.</li><li><a name="235"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#235"><strong>Place of Skulls</strong> <cite>With Vision</cite> (Southern Lord)</a><br />Yes, it's heavily Sabbath influenced, but Griffin and Wino have perfect tone and are interesting players in their own right.</li><li><a name="236"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#236"><strong>The Hidden Hand</strong> <cite>Divine Propaganda</cite> (Meteor City)</a><br />Ibid, but swap some of the christian themes for politics. Sharing this spot would be the nice 2LP retrospective of Wino's previous band, Spirit Caravan's "The Last Embrace" (...People Like You... - Germany)</li><li><a name="237"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#237"><strong>Verbena</strong> <cite>La Musica Negra</cite> (Capitol)</a><br />Great sounding album, better songs than on the pink one. Heavy, but not metal. Alabama comes through in the sounds. (Alabama the state, not the band...)</li><li><a name="238"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#238"><strong>Cobra Verde</strong> <cite>Easy Listening</cite> (Muscletone)</a><br />More consistent and winning than the last go round.</li><li><a name="239"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#239"><strong>Paul Westerberg</strong> <cite>Come Feel Me Tremble</cite> (Vagrant)</a><br />First thing I've genuinely liked since Pleased to Meet Me.</li><li><a name="240"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#240"><strong>Mark Lanegan</strong> <cite>Here Comes that Weird Chill (EP)</cite> (Beggar's Banquet)</a><br />Obviously recorded digitally, but somehow it works. Half is filler, the rest is top drawer.</li><li><a name="241"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#241"><strong>The Wrens</strong> <cite>The Meadowlands</cite> (Absolutely Kosher)</a><br />I wish it were recorded better...the hype is a bit overboard.</li><li><a name="242"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#242"><strong>Yob</strong> <cite>Catharsis</cite> (Abstract)</a><br />3 songs in 50 minutes. *the* doom metal album of the year, hands down.</li><li><a name="243"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#243"><strong>Sally Crewe &amp; the Sudden Moves</strong> <cite>Drive It Like You Stole It</cite> (12XU (UK))</a><br />Good short songs, good sequence, and having the Spoon guys be your band/producers is a big leg up. Album #2 will decide it. Best lyric of 2003: "You're too young to know, I'm too old to care."</li><li><a name="244"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#244"><strong>The Heads</strong> <cite>Sessions 02</cite> (Rocket (UK))</a><br />More abstract, kraut-y and jammy than other releases - not proper songs, but utterly compelling. Some nice quiet moments as well. This has gotten a *lot* of play. Not many made, vinyl only I think, get it while you still can!</li><li><a name="162"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#162"><strong>Sunn O)))</strong> <cite>White 1</cite> (Southern Lord)</a><br />Nice to hear Julian Cope show up here.</li><li><a name="245"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#245"><strong>Desert Sessions</strong> <cite>Vols. 9 &amp; 10</cite> (Ipecac)</a><br />PJ Harvey sounding particularly good here. These records are always a fun listen.</li><li><a name="246"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#246"><strong>Speaking Canaries</strong> <cite>Get Out Alive: The Last Type Story</cite> (Scat)</a><br />Yeah, I put it out, but it'd still be here if I hadn't. Damon is a true musical genius and anything he does is worth hearing at least once.</li><li><a name="247"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#247"><strong>Comets on Fire</strong> <cite>Field Recordings from the Sun</cite> (Badabing)</a><br />Has all the right stuff, totally crazed, but I didn't actually listen to it that much.</li><li><a name="149"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#149"><strong>Dead Meadow</strong> <cite>Shivering King and Others</cite> (Matador)</a><br />Not quite enough muscle there, too relaxed and muddled, though not unenjoyable and just right if you're in the right mood. Play side by side with The Heads to see what I mean. Their live-set-played-at-rehearsal album "At Last" (Sweet Nothing cd or Rocket LP) mines a similar, though deeper, shaft with appropriate abandon and enthusiasm. It's just out now on vinyl, but I'm pretty sure the cd is 2003.</li><li><a name="183"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#183"><strong>Dirtbombs</strong> <cite>Dangerous Magical Noise</cite> (In the Red)</a><br />I would've flipped over this 10 years ago, but at this point the "that's good enough" musicianship just annoys, though Mick's guitar playing <i>has</i> improved noticeably. He still has the best voice in garage rock though.</li></ol><p>Honorable mentions: [21-23 above --dougo] I haven't bought Pelican's "Australasia" - I suspect it would be here if I had, I dig the little I've heard a lot.<p>Reissues: Led Zep's How the West Was Won was pretty great, but I think I have enough live Zep now. I highly recommend the reish of Bevis Frond's New River Head (Rubrik) if you don't have it - along with Valedictory Songs, the best Bevis out of many many LPs (and I do have them all...) New issue includes the entire original 2LP plus bonus tracks.</p>
<p>I would've included the Strokes Room on Fire in this list if they didn't play like machines and make their records sound so tinny. Either the drummer can out-machine Robert Gotobed or this is the most pro-tooled record ever. The sound is purposefully thin, despite costing lots of money no doubt. But Casablancas does have a good voice and is not without talent lyrically. "Automatic Stop" was definitely one of my favorite songs of 2003. Standard hype rules apply - not as good as the hype, not as bad as detractors claim. As far as other 2003 hype acts, I dug the single from the new White Stripes LP, but didn't buy the album cause I felt so very, very burned by the previous LP that I bought out of curiosity. Yeah Yeah Yeahs Fever to Tell was better than I expected. Good production, nice and short, some interesting guitar playing, great drumming, Karen O is good though emotionally limited, her repeat the same word over and over trick gets used a few too many times. Grandaddy - wake me when it's over, please. So very dull, and plinky and blah...I liked the picture of them picking up trash in a park, though. This would also be the year that Yo La Tengo officially lost me. Despite repeated listens, I just could not connect with Summer Sun. I'll check back in if they ever make something rock-oriented again. Hell, song-oriented for that matter. If I want Brazilian or French flavors, or mood music, I've got those records already. Would someone please remind YLT that they're from Jersey? I just don't need the subdued bleeps and blorps and 'hey look, we just made all this stuff up!' feel of this album. They just sound lost and bored, but I suppose that appeals to some. I also keep hearing about some band called Radiohead. Didn't they have something to do with that schizo Wesley Willis guy in Chicago? Are they solo now? Naahhh, I'll pass. The singer sounds too much like Bono, can't get past that...besides I've heard a few too many times that some Brit darlings were revolutionary, then it always turns out to be revolutionary hairstyle, not music. I'm no Charlie Brown, I refuse to kick that ball! But I will admit to being a huge fan of Bernard Butler's 2nd album, so I'm not a total anglophobe...</p></p><hr /><a href="14.html">prev</a> | <a href="voters.html">list</a> | <a href="16.html">next</a></body></html>
