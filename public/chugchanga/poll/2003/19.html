Props where they're due:  If it weren't for the internet I wouldn't even know about half of this, much less have heard it.  Parenting two young boys and working at home doesn't leave much time for record shopping or zine-reading.  By the same token, there're no doubt a ton of great records that <i>aren't</i> here -- there's still a lot I missed out on.  And that's where the rest of you come in...<p>[21-30 are honorable mentions, listed alphabetically --dougo]</p></p><ol><li><a name="196"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#196"><strong>Calexico</strong> <cite>Feast of Wire</cite> (Quarterstick)</a><br />Quite simply, the best album yet from an outfit at the top of their game.  Not a clunker in the bunch.</li><li><a name="15"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#15"><strong>New Pornographers</strong> <cite>Electric Version</cite> (Matador)</a><br />Maybe not quite as strong as <i>Mass Romantic</i>, but yet another rock-solid collection of early '80s-style power pop from a bunch who know how to write a hook.  And the Dan Bejar-penned tunes can somewhat make up for a lack of new Destroyer material this past year.</li><li><a name="86"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#86"><strong>The Shins</strong> <cite>Chutes Too Narrow</cite> (Sub Pop)</a><br />Sooooo much stronger than <i>Oh, Inverted World</i>.  Gone are the muddy production and clunky drumming; instead we've got a collection of crisp, snappy pop tunes that, while all over the map stylistically, manage to gel into a coherent whole over the course of the album.  An almost perfect pop record.</li><li><a name="279"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#279"><strong>The Books</strong> <cite>The Lemon of Pink</cite> (Tomlab)</a><br />Wow, this one hit me from out of left field.  Completely unlike anything I'd heard, well, ever, The Books do a sort of folk musique concrete, taking folk guitar, banjo, etc. and cutting / sampling these snippets into lovely little songs, accompanied by obscure spoken samples and breathy vocals.   Really, really beautiful.  Maybe if Prick Decay embraced beauty instead of rusty noise they'd sound a bit like this.</li><li><a name="280"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#280"><strong>The Decemberists</strong> <cite>Castaways and Cutouts</cite> (Kill Rock Stars/Hush)</a><br />Because I always wondered what Robyn Hitchcock would sound like singing the Neutral Milk Hotel songbook.  No, really, it IS that good, and much better than the other two releases from this outfit in 2003.</li><li><a name="281"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#281"><strong>The Ponys</strong> <cite>ShiShiMuMu</cite> (Time-Lag)</a><br />Way to debut, huh?  A sprawling, double LP of psych-pop gems from this Portland, ME outfit.  The vocals are a little on the fey side, but it works for me.</li><li><a name="271"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#271"><strong>Gillian Welch</strong> <cite>Soul Journey</cite> (Acony)</a><br />Welch is one of those rare artists that can get away with releasing an album that shows absolutely zero stylistic growth.  She doesn't need to; her schtick is as old as the hills from whence it comes, and she does it exceedingly well.  On first listen, I wasn't blown away by this record, feeling it was just "more of the same."  But damn if it didn't grow on me over the year to earn its place at #7.  Beverly Hills's finest offering.</li><li><a name="282"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#282"><strong>No-Neck Blues Band</strong> <cite>Intonomancy / Ever Borneo (tie)</cite> (s@1)</a><br />Yes, I do so love NNCK.  With two glorious epics to choose from this past year, I couldn't.  A tie it is.</li><li><a name="283"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#283"><strong>The Dead C</strong> <cite>Damned</cite> (Starlight Furniture Co.)</a><br />Wow, still at it after, what, 17 years or something?  I missed out on the last 2 (<i>New Electric Music</i> and <i>(s/t)</i>), but this reaffirms my faith.  Yeah, it has its slow spots, but a couple of tracks on here are worth the price of admission alone.</li><li><a name="24"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#24"><strong>The Rapture</strong> <cite>Echoes</cite> (Strummer/Universal)</a><br />Yes, you <i>should</i> believe the hype.</li><li><a name="284"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#284"><strong>Laura Veirs</strong> <cite>Troubled by the Fire</cite> (Bella Union)</a><br />Unassuming indierock/country/folkie hipster chick from Seattle.  This album's greatness creeps up on you and smacks you in the back of the head.</li><li><a name="72"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#72"><strong>Polyphonic Spree</strong> <cite>The Beginning Stages</cite> (Hollywood)</a><br />I don't know much about 'em, but they seem a little cultish.  And not like in "cult following," but rather like in "creepy weirdos."  No matter.  Symphonic pop of the highest order.  I can't get these songs out of my head.</li><li><a name="285"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#285"><strong>The Postal Service</strong> <cite>Give Up</cite> (Sub Pop)</a><br />Oh, man.  Why do I feel dirty admitting how much I like this record?  Sugary synth pop of the PCL-era New Order magnitude, and I'll admit the guilty pleasure.  I always did love that early New Order stuff, and this album makes me feel like I'm in high school again.</li><li><a name="286"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#286"><strong>Wilco</strong> <cite>Australian EP</cite> (MP3 album from www.wilcoworld.net)</a><br />Does this count?  This 6-song EP was available as a free MP3 download to buyers of YHF on www.wilcoworld.net. As someone who's always excited about a new Wilco release, I figured I had to throw it in.  5 new songs and a fuzzed-out version of "Camera."  And if including this is cheating, then let's say the Loose Fur album on Drag City should be #14.  That's real nice, too...</li><li><a name="67"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#67"><strong>Cerberus Shoal</strong> <cite>Chaiming the Knoblessone</cite> (North East Indie)</a><br />I consider this band of oddballs my hometown answer to the Sun City Girls, and given their collaboration w/ those folks it's not too far off the mark.  Weird, carnivalesque art rock that manages to be catchy while confusing.</li><li><a name="287"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#287"><strong>Michael Yonkers Band</strong> <cite>Microminiature Love</cite> (Sub Pop)</a><br />Glad to see this guy finally getting the attention he deserves.  This is the only one he recorded as "Band," and is markedly more rockin' than the folkier solo stuff that followed.  Pretty close to the sound of early Red Crayola, but a bit more psych than art in this rock.</li><li><a name="288"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#288"><strong>Mink Lungs</strong> <cite>I'll Take It</cite> (Arena Rock Recording Co.)</a><br />Bklyn hipster weirdo psych-pop from some crackerjack musicians. Just as strong as <i>The Better Button</i> (though, alas, nothing as good as "Think of Me").</li><li><a name="10"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#10"><strong>Broken Social Scene</strong> <cite>You Forgot It In People</cite> (Arts &amp; Crafts/Paper Bag)</a><br />No, they're not the second coming of Dinosaur Jr. (or Pavement, for that matter) -- their last album was somewhat generic post-rock -- but a strong tribute to everything that was great about early '90s indie rock.  It's all so very self-consciously meta.</li><li><a name="289"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#289"><strong>M. Ward</strong> <cite>Transfiguration of Vincent</cite> (Merge)</a><br />Since I didn't hear anything new from Simon Joyner this past year, I'll have to include M. Ward's album here as my requisite dark, brooding folkie release.  Great warbly voice!  God damn I love this formula.</li><li><a name="290"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#290"><strong>Dresden Dolls</strong> <cite>s/t</cite> (Eight Foot)</a><br />Whoa!  I don't <i>even</i> know what to say.</li><li><a name="291"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#291"><strong>Clem Snide</strong> <cite>Soft Spot</cite> (spinART)</a></li><li><a name="224"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#224"><strong>Deerhoof</strong> <cite>Apple O'</cite> (5RC)</a></li><li><a name="292"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#292"><strong>Evolution Control Committee</strong> <cite>Plagiarhythm Nation</cite> (Seeland)</a></li><li><a name="48"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#48"><strong>The Fiery Furnaces</strong> <cite>Gallowsbird's Bark</cite> (Rough Trade)</a></li><li><a name="62"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#62"><strong>Lightning Bolt</strong> <cite>Wonderful Rainbow</cite> (Load)</a></li><li><a name="293"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#293"><strong>Mt.
