Starting with the White Queen at a8, capture your way to the White
King at h1.  Pieces capture as they do in chess (except pawns, which
can capture one square diagonally in any direction), and pieces can
only capture pieces of the opposite color.  However, once a capture is
made your piece becomes the type of piece that was just captured (and
moves accordingly on the next move) and all moves must end in a
capture.  Pieces that are captured are removed from the board, so the
number of pieces on the board gradually decreases.  (For an easy
warm-up, try capturing the black queen in five moves, or the black
pawn at a1 in nine moves).
