After spending the past couple years in a promo-induced coma, 2003 gave me a chance to take a breath and just see what's out there, and I found a few great mainstream records, a few great indie rock records, and a ton of great underground records.  </p><ol><li><a name="212"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#212"><strong>Bonnie "Prince" Billy</strong> <cite>Master and Everyone</cite> (Drag City)</a><br />One of Oldham's most intimate records, almost as bare as his debut.  Filled with the type of self loathing and self mocking that I can really identify with.</li><li><a name="649"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#649"><strong>Sunburned Hand of the Man</strong> <cite>Magnetic Drugs</cite> (Manhand)</a><br />One of their better CDRs (but not as good as Wild Animal or Jaybird), this has a bit more of a jazz feel.</li><li><a name="575"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#575"><strong>Sunburned Hand of the Man</strong> <cite>Closer to the Bone</cite> (Manhand)</a><br />One of their better CDRs (but not as good as Wild Animal or Jaybird), this has a bit more of a drone/drum circle feel.</li><li><a name="57"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#57"><strong>Outkast</strong> <cite>Speakerboxx/The Love Below</cite> (Arista)</a><br />This just won Grammy for best album.  What the fuck?  I haven't listened to a hip hop album this much since the early 90s which either means "this is great" or "I have been ignoring hip hop for too long" (or both!).</li><li><a name="563"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#563"><strong>Sea and Cake, The</strong> <cite>One Bedroom</cite> (Thrill Jockey)</a><br />An improvement over the bland Oui that feels like the little brother to classic The Fawn.</li><li><a name="45"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#45"><strong>Cat Power</strong> <cite>You Are Free</cite> (Matador)</a><br />She is a prick, and it's okay to hate her, but how can you resist the "My Name is Luka" redux of "Names"?</li><li><a name="62"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#62"><strong>Lightning Bolt</strong> <cite>Wonderful Rainbow</cite> (Load)</a><br />The albums are moving closer to the live show, which is great.</li><li><a name="220"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#220"><strong>Kinski</strong> <cite>Airs Above Your Station</cite> (Subpop)</a><br />More thoughtful than their glorious Pacifico album Be Gentle With the Warm Turtle, showing more Kraut and more texture, but also a bit less pop around the edges.</li><li><a name="536"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#536"><strong>Landing</strong> <cite>Passages Through</cite> (K)</a><br />Builds well off of Seasons.</li><li><a name="215"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#215"><strong>Surface of Eceyon</strong> <cite>Dragyyn</cite> (Strange Attractors)</a><br />More rock than their debut.  Why did everyone go ape shit over AMT but never listen to SOE?</li><li><a name="124"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#124"><strong>Thermals, The</strong> <cite>More Parts Per Million</cite> (Subpop)</a><br />Lo-fi redux, but more energetic and punk.</li><li><a name="402"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#402"><strong>Yo La Tengo</strong> <cite>Summer Sun</cite> (Matador)</a><br />Okay, so it's not as good as their landmark albums, and okay, it's not as good as their recent albums, but, hey, it helped pass more than a couple drab workdays.</li><li><a name="26"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#26"><strong>Mars Volta, The</strong> <cite>De-Loused in the Comatorium</cite> (Universal)</a><br />Totally immense Led Zep/Pink Floyd inspired concept album.  Admirably overzealous.</li><li><a name="429"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#429"><strong>Double Leopards</strong> <cite>Halve Maen</cite> (Eclipse)</a><br />This double LP isn't as enveloping as A Pebble in Thousands of Unmapped Revolutions but still great.</li><li><a name="213"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#213"><strong>Wind-Up Bird, The</strong> <cite>WHIPS</cite> (Music Fellowship)</a><br />A heartfelt drone record.</li><li><a name="24"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#24"><strong>Rapture, The</strong> <cite>Echoes</cite> (Universal)</a><br />DFA turns The Rapture's twitch-punk version of early The Cure into an even discoer, dancier version of sell-out-era The Cure.  And it's good.</li><li><a name="49"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#49"><strong>Four Tet</strong> <cite>Rounds</cite> (Domino)</a><br />Pure, minimal, low-key electronica.</li><li><a name="650"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#650"><strong>Stevens, Sufjan</strong> <cite>Michigan</cite> (Asthmatic Kitty)</a><br />Late year indie pop surprise that tries to do for Michigan what Brian Wilson did for California (good luck).</li><li><a name="21"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#21"><strong>Unicorns, The</strong> <cite>Who Will Cut Your Hair When We're Gone?</cite> (Alien8)</a><br />Wow, it's 1998 again, and Elephant 6 is finally dying down, with its last gasp being more experimental bands like Music Tapes and Bablicon.  No wait, it's 2003 and these Canucks are totally copping that vibe.</li><li><a name="209"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#209"><strong>Hala Strana</strong> <cite>s/t</cite> (Emperor Jones)</a><br />Amazing folk/Eastern European record by Steven R. Smith.  The Jewelled Antler CDRs are also great.</li></ol><p>If you include albums that came out before 2003 but I didn't hear til 2003, the following items might have deserved a spot:
<ul><li>
 Tape - <i>Opera</i> (Hapna)<br />
Amazing electro-acoustic album such as Gastr del Sol and Fennesz
</li><li> Sunburned Hand of the Man - <i>Headdress</i> (Records)<br />
A little abbreviated in the LP format
</li><li> Jennifer Gentle - <i>Funny Creatures Lane</i> (Sillyboy)<br />
Great, crazy, weird Zappa-inspired indie rock and drone
</li><li> Limp - <i>Orion</i> (Morr)<br />
Man from Manual's band is a lot like Manual
