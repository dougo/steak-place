Then again, probably not.</li><li><a name="57"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#57"><strong>OutKast</strong> <cite>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</cite> (Arista)</a><br />So infectious it makes me forgive The Love Below's corpulence, "Hey Ya!" sounds like Andre 3000 tried writing a Motown song without ever hearing one. Or maybe he was trying to prove that The Supremes swing just as hard as the Neptunes.</li><li><a name="55"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#55"><strong>Robert Wyatt</strong> <cite>Cuckooland</cite> (Hannibal/Ryko)</a><br />Though not as bubbly and pop-qua-pop as Shleep, the new disc also nestles comfortably amongst the singer's classic '70s work. The fan's complaint here is that Wyatt has stepped too far into the new millennium, choosing digital-keyboard presets that sound overly modern and cold (read: cheesy). But, to me at least, the album's production shortcomings only highlight the quality of the songwriting, which is fantastic throughout.</li><li><a name="58"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#58"><strong>Andrew W.K.</strong> <cite>The Wolf</cite> (Island)</a><br />Yeah, Andrew W.K.'s The Wolf is progged-out ESPN-fodder, but, God bless him, nobody else is as optimistically inclusive, full of grace, and blissfully in love with the power of hard rock.</li><li><a name="59"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#59"><strong>Various Artists</strong> <cite>Down in the Basement: Joe Bussard's Treasure Trove of</cite> (Old Hat)</a></li><li><a name="60"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#60"><strong>Missy Elliot</strong> <cite>This Is Not A Test!</cite> (Elektra)</a><br />For once even Missy's goo is badass.</li><li><a name="61"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#61"><strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> <cite>Damnation And A Day</cite> (Red Ink / Epic)</a><br />Hooky, indulgent, and often excellent.</li><li><a name="62"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#62"><strong>Lightning Bolt</strong> <cite>Wonderful Rainbow</cite> (Load)</a><br />Heavy as any metal act, Lightning Bolt is nonetheless something else entirely. The guitar-free Rhode Island duo claims not to fancy all that "Slayer-sounding stuff." Yet even if bassist Brian Gibson and drummer Brian Chippendale 
are not dark and pessimistic enough to ride with the 666 crew, they're also too monolithic, riff-gifted and improvisational to make much sense amongst today's indie and punk offerings.</li><li><a name="63"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#63"><strong>Miroslav Vitous</strong> <cite>Universal Syncopations</cite> (ECM)</a></li><li><a name="64"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#64"><strong>Dizzee Rascal</strong> <cite>Boy In Da Corner</cite> (XL)</a><br />D.R. is like a sugared-up pre-pube bouncing off walls in a sonic Pee-wee’s Playhouse. Too much too soon. And also way too cool. If only more hip hop sounded this futuristic...</li></ol><p></p><hr /><a href="4.html">prev</a> | <a href="voters.html">list</a> | <a href="6.html">next</a></body></html>
