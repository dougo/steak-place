Mills's Favorite Records of 2003</h1><p></p><ol><li><a name="327"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#327"><strong>My Morning Jacket</strong> <cite>It Still Moves</cite> (ATO)</a><br />Who says you can’t fuse DIY sensibility (Guided By Voices, Flaming Lips) to deep-roots classicism (Neil Young, Stones, Grateful Dead), along with the occasional perverse curveball (Stax-Volt, pre-Dark Side Pink Floyd)? As a bonus, we get the best Phil Spector wall-of-sound production – so much reverb it sounds like a roots-rock orchestra recorded in a shower stall -- that Spector never produced (or, most likely, will never get a chance to produce, at least not now). And dig it, the group’s crossover success, to indierockers, jamband crusties, grey-bearded dinosaurs, was a groundswell just waiting to happen. It’s the classic grassroots trickle-up theory that rarely is evidenced: indie kids catch the lo-fi vibe, followed by a bearhug from the jamband community (traditionally, the most open-minded scene in America) appreciative of the group’s hard-touring, psychedelically-inclined aesthetic, and finally the old-timers and musos circling the fringes begin taking notice of some rather adept juggling of classic influences. In short, MMJ has amassed the kind of broad fanbase most groups would kill for – a people’s band if there ever was one.</li><li><a name="277"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#277"><strong>Joe Strummer &amp; the Mescaleros</strong> <cite>Streetcore</cite> (Hellcat)</a><br />World Service bulletin: Beaming in from the great beyond, long after the eulogies have been uttered, the ale-toasts raised and the tribute albums recorded, Joe fucking Strummer gets in the last word. It’s an unnervingly powerful, cathartic final statement, too. Unsurprisingly, given how Strummer had been on a huge artistic roll with the Mescaleros, several of the tracks completed prior to his death rank among his greatest ever, from Clash-like stompers to country-gospel ballads to worldbeat-dub thumpers. Even the tracks that had to be stitched together after the fact by his bandmates display nary a ragged seam -- ragged glory, mayhaps? – including the wooliest, wooziest number they had in the can, the effects-heavy instrumental “Midnight Jam.” It’s a stream-of-consciousness psychedelic rocker highlighted by snippets of pure Strummerage: the “vocals” are posthumously sampled deejay voiceovers from the “Joe Strummer’s London Calling” BBC World Service program. This is Radio Joe, on pirate satellite.</li><li><a name="412"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#412"><strong>Carla Bozulich</strong> <cite>The Red Headed Stranger</cite> (DiChristina Stair Builders)</a><br />Willie Nelson remade/remodeled by Bozulich, who brilliantly reenvisions Nelson’s 1975 minimalist concept record (about a preacher who kills his wife) as an avant-garde passion play. Considering that the original album has been described as “the weirdest platinum-selling country album of all time,” that’s no mean feat. Leave it to maverick maiden Bozulich, alien to neither oddness (with Ethyl Meatplow) nor country (Geraldine Fibbers). Hell, while the form is still strum-and-twang on the surface, even the most country-sounding instrument here, Nels Cline’s lap steel, sounds otherworldly, broadcast from a fever dream. The title track, originally a four-minute ballad, is now an 11-minute, improv-inclined waltz for droning Autoharp, eerie Celtic fiddle and rumbling, jazzy percussion. WWWD? I’ll tell ya what Willie would do (and did) – he’d march right in to the studio and lay down a couple of duets with Bozulich.</li><li><a name="318"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#318"><strong>Television</strong> <cite>Marquee Moon</cite> (Rhino)</a><br />Finally, we get this ‘un done right (ditto its Adventure followup) after having to endure the sonically atrocious discs that marked Elektra’s first stabs at putting TV on CD. Naturally the remastered/expanded edition arrives courtesy the steady hands at Rhino. The combined Tom Verlaine/Richard Lloyd assault of edgy, riff-fueled aggression and dramatic, jazz-tinged modal jamming made the CBGBs band a legend among punks, musos and hippies alike. But am I the only one who finds the angle, as pushed by certain boneheaded pundits, of TV being the “punk rock Grateful Dead” faintly hilarious? One listen to the archival concert album, Live At The Old Waldorf, that Rhino concurrently issued on its Handmade subsidiary will blow that well-worn cliché right outta the water: in 1978, TV was arguably one of the most dynamic, least hippy-dippy performing outfits in the land.</li><li><a name="199"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#199"><strong>Al Green</strong> <cite>I Can't Stop</cite> (Blue Note)</a><br />Al Green is back. Reunited with his old Memphis producer Willie Mitchell, who even unearthed the original microphone Green used back in the ‘70s, he sounds like he only ducked out for a sec to make a quick call. That voice  -- the one indelibly seared into the memory of anyone who ever fell in love with soul on the radio via tracks like “Let’s Stay Together” or “I’m Still In Love With You” -- seems eternally youthful, and utterly confident, and just downright jubilant. Is this what it sounds like when a person is truly “one with God”? I don’t know, but Rev. Green is a walking, talking, singing example of the very essence of soul-drenched spirituality.  I Can’t Stop is truth-in-advertising: the wonderfully sensual title track itself finds Green pledging his love and his whole self to “you,” presumably a woman, possibly to the Lord, but clearly to his muse and his music, too. “Play To Win” is downright celebratory, a slice of classic fatback Southern soul, right down to the swaggering horn charts, kinetic guitar licks and sassy harmony vocals. And the album’s showstopper, “You,” brings together everything that’s great about soul in general and Green specifically: deep passion rendered in classic songwriter metaphors (“you are the sunshine of my day,” etc.) with Green in maximum “yearn” mode – yes, he can still hit those knee-weakening falsetto notes, ladies – while sweeping strings lend romance to the passion and both horns and backing vocals provide the “punch” – the sound of a heart that’s beating faster and faster by the minute. They just don’t make R&amp;b like they used to. Dump all your children’s R. Kelly CDs (and similar garbage) in the nearest landfill then hand the kids a Green greatest-hits collection along with I Can’t Stop. Tell ‘em that Al Green is about to lecture in the School of Soul, and that they’ll be tested on what they learned.</li><li><a name="413"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#413"><strong>Drive By Truckers</strong> <cite>Decoration Day</cite> (New West)</a><br />O, bubba, where art thou! From the same moonshine-charged band that gave the world a rock opera about Lynyrd Skynyrd -- the risk being that folks may hear the music in irony-laced quotation marks; certainly, songtitles like “Your Daddy Hates Me” and “Loaded Gun in the Closet” will draw  knowing winks. But peer closer: this band’s as lyrically literate as Steve Earle and as full-on garage-rockin’ as Jason &amp; the Scorchers. In the song “Sink Hole” you get a driving roadhouse number whose story line concerns a snooty banker who comes to foreclose on the family farm (“He thinks I ain’t got a lick of sense/ ‘cause I talk slow and my money’s spent,” observes the narrator) only to meet a final and -- by regional standards – just fate, stuffed in the titular crevice. It’s as vivid in its depiction of Southern mores and morals as those of the Band’s regional renderings some three decades prior. And the entire album rings (and twangs) true, plain and simple.</li><li><a name="34"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#34"><strong>White Stripes</strong> <cite>Elefant</cite> (V2)</a><br />Forget the color-coordination schtick. Forget the celeb date sightings. Forget, even, that nasty bar brawl. Instead, consider the White Stripes purely on matters of delivery and intent. On the first count,  Elefant is easily one of the year’s most refreshing-sounding records: raw, but not ragged; edgy, but not indulging the po-faced faux-edginess of the Stripes’ rockisback! peers (I’m talkin’ to you, Strokes); and just downright soulful. That’s where the second count comes in. Garage rock, or whatever one cares to call the Stripes’ stock-in-trade, has always implied a returning to the well for inspiration, and in turn, to craft a unique and personal expression – but not following some pre-set formula or fashion ideal.  “Soul” is such an amorphous, elastic concept that it’s easy to forget where it comes from: right here, inside you, nestled roughly between the brain and the heart. The Stripes, dare I say it, have tapped the mainline.</li><li><a name="414"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#414"><strong>V/A</strong> <cite>Miami Sound: Rare Funk &amp; Soul From Miami 1967-74</cite> (Soul Jazz, UK)</a><br />TK Records was Miami’s own Motown/Stax. Operating, at times, slightly off to the side of the radar yet mustering a fair share of hits during its tenure. Leave it to the venerable archivists at Soul Jazz to unearth some of the label’s most shining moments. Hats off to SJ for throwing in a detailed booklet outlining the label’s history and the performers’ bios as well. Herein be some seriously stankified stuff, from the familiar -- Timmy Thomas (“Funky Me”), Gwen “Rock Your Baby” McRae (“90% Of Me Is You”) – to the lesser-knowns, in particular Willie “Little Beaver” Hale’s slippery “Funkadelic Sound” and Clarence Reid’s swamp-funk strut “Cadillac Annie.” And hey, here’s a fun fact: Church-going teetotaler Reid also moonlighted as X-rated comedian Blowfly, of, ahem, “Girl, Let Me Cum In Your Mouth” fame. Now THAT is entertainment.</li><li><a name="415"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#415"><strong>Natalie Merchant</strong> <cite>The House Carpenter’s Daughter</cite> (Myth America)</a><br />Merchant has much to answer for, not the least of which is the cloying, uber-precious artiste image she fostered while fronting the equally crunchy 10,000 Maniacs. Somebody tell me why, a decade later, critics would decry the likes of Jewel for basically pulling the same act, yet no one ever called Merchant on it? Indeed, I used to despise the smug little twat, which, curiously, makes my newfound conversion all the more gratifying as I tuck in my napkin and settle down for a nice big plate of crow. (Roccrits should always jump at a chance to indulge revisionism, eh?) What’s unfortunate is that due to certain logistics surrounding the distribution of the album – self-released by Merchant, it’s being sold “one-way” (no returns) to just a handful of wholesalers and retailers  – in 2003 it remained elusive to many consumers, not to mention its limited availability to the press meant that fewer reviews than usual were published. Consider this your chance to catch up, then. By ditching all major label-fueled expectations re: what her public wants, and instead dipping – nay, diving – wholly into traditional Americana, Merchant sounds a lady reborn. From swirling, Fairport Convention-styled dronefests (“Sally Ann”) and actual covers of the Fairports (“Crazy Man Michael”) to desolate, minimalist gospel-blues (“Which Side Are You On?”) and jubilant little banjo/fiddle struts (“House Carpenter”), this collection of cover material not only serves to carve out a welcome new niche for Merchant – interpreter, keeper of the flame – but allows her to regain the soul that she long ago surrendered at the altar of alterna-rock divadom.</li><li><a name="196"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#196"><strong>Calexico</strong> <cite>Feast Of Wire</cite> (Quarterstick)</a><br />Casting the music of Calexico in evocative, if sometimes imprecise, shadings has become quite the parlor game for journalists ever since the Tucson outfit surfaced in the mid ‘90s. Initially a Giant Sand offshoot duo, Calexico has since expanded both artistically (as evidenced across nine albums) and literally (a revolving cast of players sometimes finds as many as ten musicians onstage at a Calexico gig). Reviewers, however, haven’t necessarily kept a similar pace. Whether smitten or flummoxed by Calexico’s open-ended sound, they tend to rely on pat Southwestern imagery: “border pop,” “mariachi garage,” “desert noir,” etc. This isn’t particularly vexing for the two man Calexicans, Joey Burns and John Convertino; they are, after all, residents of the Old Pueblo and deeply enamored of the region’s heritage. And granted, Feast Of Wire  does open on the very Calexicoesque, accordion-and-twang “Sunken Waltz.” The gloves come off, quickly, however, with a brace of otherworldly numbers at times gothic, ambient, psychedelic and jazzy – the latter, in the Gil Evans/Charles Mingus-styled “Crumble,” all blatting metro horns and decidedly un-twangy guitar. At a point in time where indie rockers across the globe seem to think that by snagging a few “non-rock” instruments and recording any half-baked “experimental” idea that comes into their pointy l’il heads they summarily qualify as sonic adventurists, Calexico is, without doubt, the real fucking deal.</li><li><a name="416"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#416"><strong>Let's Active</strong> <cite>Cypress/Afoot, Big Plans For Everybody, Every Dog Has His Day</cite> (Collectors Choice)</a><br />Given the opportunity to reassess artistic legacies – in particular, those of defunct bands – most critics (and fans, too) will jump. This scenario becomes all the more intriguing when a congruence of events works to unexpectedly spotlight a particular musical artist on multiple fronts. That’s the case right now with Let’s Active. The Winston-Salem, NC, eighties pop group was recently given the tribute album treatment (Every Word, issued by Australia’s Laughing Outlaw label), which led to a one-off Let’s Active reunion (of sorts) at the trib’s CD release party. Forthcoming is a proposed boxed set of archival material on Italy’s No Tyme. And Let’s Active mainman Mitch Easter is now fronting his first band over a decade and a half, The Fiendish Minstrels, with an album due in the near future.


So the timing couldn’t be any sweeter for the arrival of these three reissues. The two-fer pairing Let’s Active’s 1983 debut EP Afoot (a home demo that, after landing the trio a record deal with I.R. S. Records, was given some brushing-up and remixing) and its long-playing ’84 followup Cypress essentially copies the out-of-print CD issued by I.R.S. in ’89. It includes the same two bonus tracks: “Grey Scale” (from the British version of the Cypress LP) and “Two Yous” (from ’82 Afoot sessions, originally appearing in 1986 on a UK 12” single). But as with Collectors’ Choice’s 2001 repackaging of Easter’s Tarheel peers The dB’s, copious liner notes, courtesy veteran scribe Scott Schinder, have been added to make the CD booklet alone worth the price of admission. Even better, the tunes themselves have aged handsomely. Easter’s songwriting wasn’t particularly indebted to an era or genre, making Afoot’s “Room With A View,” for example, a lovably odd amalgam of New Wave (dancey bass, chirpy keys), vintage Girl Group (bassist Faye Hunter’s yearning lead vocal) and psychedelia. Given an actual budget for Cypress, Easter allowed his eclectic muse full reign. Improbable collisions of sitar, neoclassical keyboards, glam-slam guitars and a sprinkling of 12-string jangles turn “Waters Part” into a compositional masterpiece, while the rhythmic switchbacks, fretboard flourishes and baroque mood of “Lowdown” suggests a complex homage to Britain’s Roy Wood and The Move. The album did have its share of sweet nougat – check the buoyant guy-gal harmonies in “Easy Does” and the chunky powerpop of “Blue Line” (a cover of British band The Outskirts) -- but every song had its own distinct character.

1986’s Big Plans For Everybody, recorded under semi-crisis conditions -- the original lineup was dissolving drummer Sara Romweber having already split -- is probably best characterized as a solo Easter effort with guests, including soon-departing Hunter plus incoming keyboardist/vocalist Angie Carlson. (Inexplicably, Collectors’ Choice has omitted the auxiliary players’ contributions from the credits, something that the old I.R.S. CD booklet did not do; luckily, Schinder’s liner notes help keep things straight. There’s also a major goof on the sleeve’s tracklisting: “Last Chance Town” gets erroneously retitled “Last Chance To Win.”) As such, Big Plans is a tougher, more complex effort, reflective of Easter’s late ‘60s/early ‘70s hard rock/psych/garage roots. From the wiry, “Cold Turkey”-esque riffs of “Last Chance Town” and the shimmery Prog informing “Still Dark Out” to the backwards effect-laden psychedelia of “Writing The Book Of Last Pages” and the wholly unexpected slide-guitar instrumental raveup that is “Route 67,” the album serves as a sonic showcase of Easter’s many musical obsessions. It also boasts, in lush, keyboard-laden opening track “In Little Ways,” a drop-dead Let’s Active classic every bit as memorable as Cypress’ “Waters Part.” Two heretofore unreleased bonus cuts from the Big Plans sessions, “Horizon” (lead vocals by Hunter) and “Invisible Hills,” round out the disc.

Speaking of “Horizon,” by the time of 1988’s Every Dog Has His Day Angie Carlson had been a full-time Active-ist for a couple of years (Eric Marshall and John Heames were the new rhythm section), and for Dog she handles lead vocals on a reworked, and utterly mesmerizing, “Horizon” plus several other songs. As recorded in the UK with British producer John Leckie, the album has its charms, although Easter himself, in Schinder’s liner notes, singles out a number of ill-informed moves (such as Leckie applying reverb like a house painter slaps on exterior latex, and the inclusion of the overtly arena-esque “big rock” number “Too Bad”) that tether the album to the ‘80s era – unlike its two out-of-time predecessors. That said, songs such as the aforementioned “Horizon,” the jittery “I Feel Funny,” which hearkens stylistically back to the band’s New Wave period, and the widescreen psych-popper of a title track all prove that Let’s Active’s well had in no way run dry. As with Big Plans, two unreleased tracks, alternate versions of “Bad Machinery” and “Sweepstakes,” have been added as bonus material. 



By this point, however, I.R.S. was only halfheartedly doling out the promotion, although it did release to radio  “Every Dog Has His Day” as a 12” single featuring custom sleeve art boasting of celebrity fan Robert Plant’s endorsement of  Let’s Active during his guest VJ stint on MTV. Diminishing label interest, a crumbling personal relationship between Easter and Carlson and a changing of the musical guard as the Nirvana era loomed eventually dictated that Easter lay the group to rest. He’d go on to sit out the ‘90s in order to concentrate on production duties at his Winston-Salem recording studio.

Ironically, the prevailing image of Southern indie-rock during the ‘80s remains one of scruffy kids wielding jangly guitars and penning Big Star/Velvet Underground-informed pop tunes. Yet Easter, one of the so-called chief architects of kudzu rock – he was co-producer of the early R.E.M. records and studio mentor to scores of regional pop combos -- turned out to be the myth-breaker. With the chance, now,  to take a fresh look at Easter’s musical legacy, it’s clear that Let’s Active was the least jangly of ‘em all. God bless him for that too – Mitch Easter, last of the great Southern subversives.</li><li><a name="417"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#417"><strong>Turbonegro</strong> <cite>Apocalypse Dudes</cite> (Epitaph)</a><br />Equal parts hirsute, headbanger-stoner fuh, neo-‘70s biker rawk and walk-on-the-wildside leatherboy punk, Sweden’s Turbonegro disbanded in ’98, just a few months before their masterpiece Apocalypse Dudes saw release (in the US, jointly issued by Sympathy and the late, great Man’s Ruin). Apparently the flamboyantly unhinged vocalist Hank Von Helvete needed to take a “dude, interrupted” sabbatical, although by that point the six-piece had cum, seen and conquered, leaving behind four memorable platters whose stature would grow over the next few years in the wake of celebrity testimonials from the likes of Dave Grohl, Rocket From The Crypt, Queens Of The Stone Age, Steve Albini and Jello Biafra. Last summer, Helvete having wrapped up his funny farm chores, the band got back together; a new album, Scandinavian Leather, featuring artwork by Klaus “Revolver” Voorman, is due in April. Timely, given the current Scandinavian rock (Hives, Soundtrack Of Our Lives, Hellacopters, Division Of Laura Lee, International Noise Conspiracy, etc.) invasion.

Ass Cobra first reared its shiny head in ’96. Given that Turbonegro’s capacity for schtick-shoveling is an entire discussion in itself, I’ll restrict my non-musical comments other than to note that it’s kinda hard to overlook the album’s Tom Of Finland-meets-Pet Sounds sleeve art, singer Helvete’s nekkid-with-python center photo spread and songtitles such as “I Got Erection,” “Sailor Man” and that tender ode to forbidden love, “The Midnight NAMBLA.” In a nutshell, then, the band’s punk-hardcore roots are rigidly on display here: the powercharged “Denim Demon” not only sounds like a speeded-up Ramones romp, it quotes from Patti Smith’s “Rock ‘n’ Roll Nigger”; “A Dazzling Display Of Talent” could pass for an outtake from Australian thug-punkers The Cosmic Psychos; and the feral vocal growl and “my generation sucks” sentiments of “Hobbit Motherfuckers” makes you long for the glory days of Black Flag. Throw in a stiff dose or two of venereal rocker G.G. Allin and you just about got it.

But Apocalypse Dudes is where the pedal hits the metal, a jackbooted blast from the near-past that references all of the above and more. (Including the Village People, judging from the band photos which, aside from Helvete’s inexplicably swapping his mustachio’d cabana-boy image for a more lurid King Diamond look, are a study in sailor, cowboy and construction – not too many Indians in Sweden, one s’poses – chic). Every song’s a swaggering winner, from the fiery “Search And Destroy” knockoff “Self Destructo Bust” and the Ramones (“I Just Want To Have Something To Do”)-meets-Alice Cooper (“I’m Eighteen”) thrasher “Get It On,” to the brutally efficient, Blue Oyster Cult-styled anthemism of “Rock Against Ass” and the rump-riding Judas Priest/Quiet Riot stylings of “Rendezvous With Anus.” And while I’m somewhat loathe to parse too many lines – what can be said, after all, about a passage like “Fornicator of the lasso/ Sperminator of the asshole/ Prince of the rodeo”? – there’s still something refreshingly Spinal Tap-ish going on that no lover of rock arcana can resist. Consider: over-the-top, neo-orchestral album opener “The Age Of Pamparius,” with its “Back In Black” riffage and “whoah-woah-ohh!” massed chanting, sounds like the kind of fist-pumping arena crud that fueled many a teen rebel anthem back in the day. By ’99, however, complaining about being stuck behind the counter at a fast-food joint was what passed for rebellion, as Turbonegro’s incisive lyric study suggests: “So you think you had a pepperoni/ So you think you had a calzone/ So you thought you could make your own/ So you thought you could take it home/ Apocalypse dudes got nothing to lose/ Gonna bake a motherfucking pizza tonight!” Amen. Pass the Parmesan.</li><li><a name="418"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#418"><strong>Gov't Mule</strong> <cite>The Deepest End: Live In Concert</cite> (ATO)</a><br />Just over a year ago I sat down to interview Warren Haynes, vocalist and fretboard wizard for the mighty Gov’t Mule. We talked about his band’s then-latest releases, The Deep End Vols. 1 &amp; 2, which saw Haynes, keyboardist Danny Louis and drummer Matt Abts squaring off with a legion of internationally-known bassists (everyone from John Entwistle, Jack Bruce and Phil Lesh to Metallica’s Jason Newsted, Phish’s Mike Gordon and Widespread Panic’s Dave Schools). Underlying the urge to collaborate and jam with gifted players, suggested Haynes, was a burning need to keep pushing the envelope, to challenge oneself, to get as far out there on the edge – and beyond -- as possible.

Certainly no more compelling evidence of that artistic drive exists at the moment than The Deepest End, recorded last May at New Orleans’ storied Saenger Theatre. True to its two studio predecessors, a who’s-who of low-end theorists turned up, among them Newsted, Schools, Gordon, Jack Casady, Roger Glover, Les Claypool and the Meters’ George Porter, Jr. Others with walk-ons at the marathon show included Bela Fleck, slide virtuoso Sonny Landreth, and funk legends Fred Wesley and Bernie Worrell. (Bonus points to the Mule’s Abts, who performs above and beyond the call of duty by handling kit chores for the duration. He is, verily, a man of iron.) Yet while raw stats are impressive enough – 5 ½ hours, 36 songs, 13 bassists and 25 total guests – the combined sonic and visual impact of this 2-CD, 1-DVD package is nigh-on impossible to convey on paper. 


How, then, can I count the ways? Hmm… (1) A sinewy, swinging, jazzy “John The Revelator” featuring Haynes uncorking edgy slide riffs over the honks, blats and squalls of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band Horns. (2) The luminous, soulful and otherworldly Haynes original Beautifully Broken” (w/Porter on bass) that interpolates portions of Prince’s “When Doves Cry.” (3) A visceral take of Allen Toussaint’s New Orleans classic “On Your Way Down” with bottleneck marksmen Haynes and Landreth dueling to the death. (4) An astonishing 14-minute “Voodoo Chile” wherein Casady reprises his original Electric Ladyland role and Haynes bays at the moon like a junkyard dog. 

And that’s just four out of 36. Intriguingly, the combined CD-DVD package is set up so that you get 2 ½ hours of audio and about 3 ½ hours of video. Ergo, some songs are exclusive to either the CDs or the DVD, while certain tracks appear in both formats. Sound quality, of course, is beyond reproach, and the camerawork on the DVD is uniformly outstanding. (Funny, too –  as credits roll at the end of the DVD, mini-testimonials begin appearing onscreen, Haynes alternately getting toasted and roasted by his guests. Clearly a man who has earned the admiration of peers and legends alike.) In fact, this just may qualify as one of the most riveting live artifacts I’ve encountered in years – certainly the best live release of 2003.


One particular DVD extra bears noting, a documentary video about the concert featuring rehearsal footage and interview clips. Echoing what Haynes said to me during our interview last year, various players comment about the inextricably twinned thrill/fear of improvisation. Dave Schools in particular cites the allure “of going to places that are unsafe… to get out there,” and that’s precisely the vibe one gets taking in The Deepest End – musicians in full flight, without a net.</li><li><a name="419"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#419"><strong>The Ribeye Brothers</strong> <cite>New Ways To Fail, aka, Ding Ding, Here Comes The Shitmobile: Demos &amp; Shit 2003</cite> ((demo))</a><br />Does anyone even make demos anymore? Judging by the deluge of indie crap that arrived in my mailbox this year, it would seem that yesteryear’s “demo recording” is the modern-day equivalent of an independent label release. The only difference is that in place of hand-scrawled songtitles on a cassette J-card you now get a full-color 4-panel CD booklet. And used record stores won’t take either of  ‘em for trade or cash! One item that turned up destined neither for file 13 nor the “dump” pile, however, is a ten-song CDR from The Ribeye Brothers. These Jersey miscreants hit paydirt a couple of years ago with their self-released If I Had A Horse…(it included the song “If I Had A Horse I’d Buy It Oats And Fuck It”) which was subsequently picked up by the Meteor City label. Since then, Brothers Tim Cronin and Jon Kleimans (both of Monster Magnet as well as Meteor City “stuporgroup” Gallery Of Mites) have been slowly accumulating new material, of which New Ways To Fail, aka, Ding Ding, Here Comes The Shitmobile: Demos &amp; Shit 2003 is quite the compilation. You may swoon to “Lonesome Rhodes,” which neatly manhandles Curtis Mayfield’s “Don't Worry) If There's a Hell Below We're All Going to Go” in a slide-guit, organ-drenched miasma o’ boogie. Or you may be sucker-punched by the psychedelic autobiography sketched out in the chilling loser’s lament called “Roberto Duran.” And Wilco fans will be alternately thrilled and terrified by a live rehearsal run-through of Jeff Tweedy’s timeless “I Got Drunk.” But for my money – and having inside knowledge of Cronin’s peculiar musical sensibilities – the, er, money shot here is a pan-fried cover of the Scientists’ “Swampland,” all twang, trash and bluster, from the growly, megaphone-y vox to the rockabilly gallumph of the rhythm section to the raveup guitar break that’s nine parts water, one part sand, and several parts John Fogerty and Jeff Beck. Yee fucking haw, y’all.</li><li><a name="420"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#420"><strong>R.E.M.</strong> <cite>Zeche Bochum DVD</cite> (New Depression Music)</a><br />Anybody riled up and/or made misty-eyed by the recent R.E.M. tour in which the boys from Athens pulled out all sorts of oldies -- this (silver) disc's for you. A vintage German TV broadcast – recorded in Bochum 10/2/85 --  from the "Rockpalast" program, source of many a coveted converted-from-P.A.L.-format VHS tape over the years -- this captures 'em at an early peak, circa the Fables Of The Reconstruction album. There's Michael Stipe, bleached blond hair (and newly-shorn locks) and black eyeliner, alternately solemn and sarcastic at the mic; Mike Mills and Pete Buck, still in their bouncing ping-pong balls mode; and Bill Berry, mono-browed and assured at his kit. Ah, the memories... With a setlist well-stuffed with R.E.M. classics and even more classic covers (of Television, the Stones, Aerosmith, Creedence, even Roger Miller) and so many classic MOMENTS (such as Stipe pledging allegiance to the flag to intro "Little America"), how can you pass this up? I saw R.E.M. many times during this period and can personally testify that the TV broadcast absolutely does justice to their natural charisma, their offhand sense humor and their undeniable rock 'n' roll prowess. It's a great transfer too, with only very slight graininess detectable to indicate it's not taken directly from the broadcast itself. A notation at the end reads "Rockpalast Classics" -- possibly this was a subsequent rebroadcast that netted a high-quality recording somewhere in the loop. The packaging is outstanding, too. The DVD itself is a picture disc, and housed in the clear plastic clamshell is a full-color 2-sided insert with stills from the broadcast.</li><li><a name="421"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#421"><strong>Bob Dylan</strong> <cite>Eat The Document DVD</cite> (Watchdog)</a><br />Back history: this was a D.A. Pennebaker-filmed, Dylan/Howard Alk-edited documentary of the legendary ’66 Dylan/Band tour of Europe, and while ABC-TV had commissioned the project, the network deemed it “too vulgar” for TV and rejected it outright. (Gee, could it have been due to Scene 55’s extended segment of a jabbering stoned/drunk Dylan and John Lennon?) Since then, it has surfaced on a limited official basis at film festivals and such but has never appeared in any genuine commercial or retail form. As a result, grainy/flawed bootleg versions have been what the public has had to put up with. Until now. UK boot label Watchdog landed a clean 16mm print and mastered it to DVD, yielding an outstanding video transfer and, for the most part – given the 16mm source -- a solid audio transfer too. And not only is there a fantastic 24-page booklet that takes you through the 54-minute film scene-by-scene that comes with the package, 20 minutes of DVD extras are included on the disc: “Ballad of a Thin Man” (outtake), Bob Dylan and John Lennon In a Car (outtake), and Bob Arrives in Sweden (B&amp;w newsreel footage). Insanely fascinating stuff. Hunt it while you can – only a thousand copies were made. Verily, one of rock’s most holiest of grails.</li><li><a name="422"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#422"><strong>V/A</strong> <cite>Tales From The Australian Underground: Singles 1976-89</cite> (Peel Presents, AUS)</a><br />Long before Kurt Cobain’s junk-corroded, splattered brains came to define rock ‘n’ roll’s unruly, primitive spirit, bands such as Radio Birdman, Died Pretty, Cosmic Psychos, The Birthday Party, etc. were doing the troglodyte stomp with booze-fueled finesse. If you picked up the 2002 Oz collection Do The Pop!  and dug that, you’ll dig this too. Fun fact: Included are The Scientists, a huge influence on St. Cobain’s Mudhoney pals.</li><li><a name="423"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#423"><strong>Windbreakers</strong> <cite>Time Machine (Greatest Hits ’82-’02)</cite> (Paisley Pop)</a><br />Once upon a time, way down in kudzu land there dwelled Mississippi’s Windbreakers, whose gifted songwriting axis Tim Lee and Bobby Sutliff helped spearhead, along with regional kindred spirits R.E.M., Let’s Active and The dB’s, the ‘80s powerpop charge (key artifact: 1985’s Terminal, on Homestead Records). Since the band’s dissolution a decade ago, Lee and Sutliff have surfaced (and even reunited) on occasion -- both also issued solo albums this year – including selected dates to plug this long overdue retrospective. First off, you get a pair of new tunes produced by longtime collaborator Mitch Easter (Let’s Active): Sutliff’s wistful, harmony-rich title composition, and the shimmery 12-string jangler “Basket Case” (penned by popster Neilson Hubbard).18 archival nuggets follow, reaching as far back as 1983’s Any Monkey With A Typewriter EP. The compilation wisely lingers on the Terminal LP via six of the band’s most out-of-time cuts, including the dark, surf-tinged psychedelia of “Changeless” and a garagey cover of Television’s “Glory” which features Lee and Sutliff backed up by L.A.’s paisley-psych combo The Rain Parade. Those are followed by few tracks apiece from the subsequent three albums (1986’s Run, 1989’s At Home With Bobby &amp; Time, 1991’s Electric Landlady). The cumulative effect of all this uncommonly sophisticated, well-crafted pop-rock is less akin to a nostalgia fest than a call to arms for aficionados of the genre: Somebody reissue the entire Windbreakers’ back catalog pronto!</li><li><a name="424"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#424"><strong>No River City</strong> <cite>This Is Our North Dakota</cite> (Six Little Shoes)</a><br />When this Atlanta duo debuted earlier this year with the “Burn Down Our Own Home” single, yours truly was instantly smitten, comparing NRC’s strummy, harmony-strewn sound to that of Alejandro Escovedo and Whiskeytown. The 45 was scant preparation, however, for the impact the new full-length bow wields. Let’s face it, folks can namedrop as many alt-country pioneers and icons they wish – in NRC’s case, Gram &amp; Emmylou, Jayhawks, Richard Buckner, Ryan Adams and Escovedo clearly loom large as influences – but at the end of the day, it really boils down to, does the musical act have memorable tunes, and does it bring something unique to the table? Here, on both counts, the answer is an unequivocal ‘yes.’ The lovely original “Fainter On My Tongue,” for example, finds Drew de Man, against a backdrop burnished guitars and co-vocalist Terri Kay Onstad’s lush cello lines, ruminating on a relationship that grew violent (“you kissed me with a left hook/ leave me standing like a scarecrow”) and went south. The tone of rueful regret in de Man’s voice is so convincing you can’t help but wonder if the tune’s painful to perform night after night. It’s a dark album, in fact (the title is instructive), made darker still by a cover of U2’s harrowing junkie portrait “Running To Stand Still.” It’s deceptively upbeat and twangy, with a buoyant de Man/Onstad vocal duet in the foreground and a sweet accordion figure running throughout. Yet the shock of recognition -- at unexpectedly hearing a tune from the past so expertly overhauled as to suggest it was originally written with such a country-rock arrangement in mind – is what  lends “RTSS” its power. In this instance, the cover bests the original. Like the telltale taste of a shot of dope on the back of your tongue just before the body rush hits, the song is delicious, erotically charged and absolutely terrifying.</li><li><a name="425"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#425"><strong>The Meters</strong> <cite>Fiyo At The Fillmore Vol. 1</cite> (Too Funky/Fuel 2000)</a><br />As we all know, the Meters story didn’t end in 1977. The group got back together in 1990 and has since rode a crest of revived popularity not dissimilar to that enjoyed by George Clinton with his P-Funk All Stars. David Russell Batiste, Jr. replaced drummer Modeliste, and after fretboard virtuoso Brian Stoltz subsequently took over for Nocentelli the Meters changed their name to The Funky Meters even as a whole new generation of tie-dyed, jamband-centric kids was discovering the pleasures of the groove. That’s where Fiyo At The Fillmore Volume 1 comes in. Taped in March of 2001 at San Fran’s venerable Fillmore Auditorium, this outstanding concert disc takes some good ole funky music directly to the streets, serving up key Meters classics such as “People Say,” “Cissy Strut” and “Fire On The Bayou,” each one now topping the ten-minute mark to allow for maximum rump-wiggling time. The latter swamp-funk gem has over the years become a classic band-audience singalong  and here one readily imagines the entire Fillmore knee-deep in the aforementioned groove as Stoltz unleashes peals of Hendrix-like licks, Neville answers with supple keyboard runs of his own and Batiste and Porter undulating with a proverbial tight-but-loose precision.  If ever there was a monicker that fit a group perfectly – ladies and gents, meet the Funky Meters.</li></ol><p>SOME RANDOM THOUGHTS AND OBSERVATIONS....

For whatever reasons – short attention span syndrome triggered by onset of early geezerdom, a deep-nagging desire to finally bond with the download generation, etc. – I listened to a lot of music this year on a track-by-track basis. And 2003 struck me as a year in which, given the one-song-at-a-time imperative as forged by the aforementioned download generation, singles stood a chance once again to matter. Not “matter” as in, what dipshit rapper is featured as a guest or what lame remix appears as a B-side, but as in, actually having some sort of meaningful content. There’s the paradox: singles are supposed to be fun, frivolous, temporary and throwaway, right? To those of us with long memories, not necessarily. I can still recall the music of revolution and transformation being the occasional domain of mainstream radio back in the late ‘60s; back then, the thrill of hearing, say, the Doors’ “Break On Through,” or Jefferson Airplane’s “Volunteers,” or Hendrix’ version of “All Along The Watchtower,” or CSN’s “Wooden Ships” or even the Beatles’ “Revolution” come over the car radio was nearly as visceral as seeing the nightly images on TV of protesting students and soldiers in Vietnam.</p><p>


I’m deluding myself, of course; the short attention span syndrome among America’s youth (as triggered by prolonged exposure to GameBoy and X-box radiation) ensures a blithe, blissful existence, unencumbered by controversy or dissonance, for most. But hey, this is my world, not theirs, I’m writing about, so for me, 2003-by-singles meant pondering some notions, in varying degrees of specificity, of personal and cultural metaphysics: Joe Strummer’s cover of Marley’s “Redemption Song,” issued as both a promo single and a 45 in the UK; the Mavericks’ “I Want To Know,” drawn from an otherwise tepid album full soft-rock noodling only a Josh “1972” Rouse fan could love; Steve Winwood’s surprisingly soulful, grooveworthy “Why Can’t We Live Together,” a cover of the old Timmy Thomas TK Recs hit; and of course Johnny Cash’s astounding take on Trent Reznor’s “Hurt,” made all the more vivid thanks to the accompanying video.</p><p> 


As this was the year I found myself overwhelmingly repoliticized – I was neatly primed last year by Steve Earle’s “John Walker Blues” and the entire Jerusalem album, so much so that I even found myself writing a few letters to the editor in ’03! -- I was also irresistibly drawn to the outright political commentary found wafting about in the ether. Hey let’s face it: SOMEBODY has to stand up and offer an alternative to the redneck, jingoistic likes of Toby “Shock ‘n Y’all” Keith. If Fleetwood Mac’s “Peacekeeper” was too subtle for the mainstream to grasp its real message (subtle enough to prevent the group getting Dixie Chicked, eh?) there were some fairly in-your-face statements available for the listening, from Black Eye Peas’ anti-CIA lyrics in “Where Is The Love” to R.E.M.’s anti-war anthem “The Final Straw” (sadly, not included on the group’s Best Of collection and only available at www.remhq.com as a free MP3 download) to Ed Sanders’ needs-no-qualifying “Impeach George Bush.” The latter, one should note, was also a MP3. It could and still can be found, along with a host of other left-leaning, wholly righteous tunes, at www.protest-records.com, a free download site mounted by Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore (who himself uploaded a track he and Mike Watt recorded, “Fourth Of July”). If there was ever the voice of the people being distilled and concentrated into one neat little corner of the Internet, Protest-Records is it.</p><p>

This leaves the Outkast tune, “Hey Ya.” I guess one day we’ll need a party theme song for when Bush is kicked out of office, and this will do just fine. A million (squared) downloaders can’t be wrong, now, can they?</p><p>


Honorable mention: Karl Denson’s Tiny Universe Check Out Your Mind (Relaxed), which technically came from the Aug. ’02 album The Bridge but was subsequently picked up by numerous public radio and adult contemporary format stations thanks to its sleek groove and timely message – courtesy the song’s author, one Curtis Mayfield.</p><p>


WORST ALBUMS</p><p>

The Strokes Room On Fire (RCA)
Does anyone honestly care about Peaches? About, I mean, her alleged “potty-mouth” and the critics who cite same in reviews? Can we add “potty-mouth” to the list of banned words for ’04? And take Ryan Adams – please. Really, who gives a fuck whether he used to be the alt-country scene’s preeminent wylde chylde but is now a “postmodern classicist” (or some such crit-blather) dipping his talented tippy-toes into retro waters? Does anyone smell VH1 Classic in the kid’s future? But I digress. The worst album of the year: The Strokes Room On Fire.  Jeez, it seems, like… soooo yesterday.  Now don’t get me wrong; I loved the ’01 debut. But someone – it won’t be Spin -- needs to say it: the emperor has no clothes, and this album has no goddam tunes. In lieu of actual verses, choruses, bridges, codas, etc. you get a skeletal collection of half-assed riffs, sloppy bass lines, monotonous beats (please shoot the rhythm section) and screechy, overly compressed vox. Not to mention the most one-dimensional, dynamics-free production this side of an old cereal box record. Incredibly enough, an album that retroactively justifies all the preemptive/preliminary backlash that the haters were heard dispensing last year.</p><p>


Lucinda Williams World Without Tears (Lost Highway). More like Letdown Without Warning – dang, what happened Luce (and what’s up with that faux-rap thing you’re doing? ). This is a sloppy, hastily-conceived affair. Sheesh. I think I’ll just copy my year-end comments for 2001’s Essence – which was my fave album of that year – and if you simply change all positive sentiments to negative and you’ve got my thoughts on WWT.  On Essence: “For a quote/unquote “alt-country rec,” this is about as uncliched as they come, an intimate, oftentimes fearless portrayal of emotional stasis and how it can bring one’s life to a shuddering halt. It’s also erotic as hell – “C’mon baby, let me taste your stuff,” Williams purrs, as if she were a phone-sex operator dialing in from somewhere down on Main Street. And sonically, it’s got an uncommon potency and heft that artists, it must be said, rarely chance upon twice.” With WWT, that latter prediction comes true.</p><p>

Arab Strap Monday At The Hug And Pint (Matador)
It’s telling enough the working title for Arab Strap’s fifth studio album was The Cunted Circus. For not even the more cuddlesome one head Strappers Aiden Moffat and Malcolm Middleton settled upon will land ‘em a “G” rating; these tunes about pathological losers, drunkards, brigands and sluts are cast, titular-wise, along lines of “Act Of War,” “Flirt” and “Fucking Little Bastards.” What, you expected a Barney singalong from a band named after a marital aid? Business as usual, then, for a group that never met a personal relationship it couldn’t twist into a vicious anecdote or a seedy memoir. Musically speaking, Arab Strap’s bleak brand of post-folk gets a facelift here and there, primarily through the full-time introduction of violin and cello, bringing to the surface what an oftentimes subliminal orchestral vibe. Ultimately, though, the listener’s attention is prone to wandering over the course of this 46-minute trip down the pub. Following a strong opening gambit (the disco-flavored “The Shy Retirer”) it’s a full four more songs before the band hits another peak, with the polyrhythmic, dreamy “Flirt” – which, significantly or not, features musical contributions, as does “Act Of War,” from outsiders (Bright Eyes’ Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis). Perhaps an EP was more in order; after imbibing the brilliantly besotted soul of 2001’s The Red Thread, this is like sipping nonalcoholic beer.</p><p> 

Bon Jovi This Left Feels Right (Island)
This may seem like a sittting duck but I have a confession: I’ve always liked Bon Jovi. But no, this left does not feel right. This left feels like veering wildly and driving straight off a cliff into a flooded ravine some 100 feet below. It’s the sound of men who are dangerously pussywhipped -- by Heather Locklear, Calista Flockhart, who knows? – and have been taking some bad medicine, er, advice. Granted, MTV’s Unplugged made it acceptable for dyed-in-the-wool rockers to get in touch with their sensitive sides (to this day I think the best “Unplugged” episodes were not the ones by 10,000 Maniacs or Eric Clapton, but the Great White and Alice In Chains segments), and nowadays it’s commonplace for a group to tinker with its back catalogue. Remake/remodel or rehash/recycle? Only a true fan’s inner logic can say.</p><p>

Moi, well, one of life’s guiltiest of pop pleasures has always been Bon Jovi’s “Livin’ On A Prayer.” With its pulse-quickening dynamics and deftly-wrung melody it’s a memorable slice of Jersey shore blue-collar rock that pushes the same musical and emotional buttons as many of Springsteen’s you-and-me-babe-against-the-odds anthems. The singer’s subtle but very real sigh of resignation that comes at the end of the lines, “Gina dreams of running away/ When she cries in the night/ Tommy whispers, baby it’s okay – someday”, is, perversely, one of rock’s great dramatic highs, conveying more in a single breath than most artists come up with in entire careers.</p><p>

Prayers can’t help Tommy and Gina now, however, terminally potbellied and saggy-boobed and with their once-timeless teenage anthem cruelly turned into a soggy bowl of MOR duet mush courtesy Jon Bon J and actress Olivia d’Abo, the teen-poon princess who once played Fred Savage’s hippie sister in The Wonder Years (but, like Gina, now lives a life of diminishing returns – Tarzan And Jane, anyone?). This new version, with its muted acoustic strums, crystalline keyboard flurries and cardboard percussion, twinkles and wheezes with all the pizzazz of a New Age flute concerto. And while I’m mildly fascinated by an admittedly adventurous reworking of the vocal melody, d’Abo’s side of the duet is so emotionally uninvolved – did she stash some ‘ludes scored from some dealer during those wonder years? -- as to deaden whatever lingering impact the song had. It’s hokier than a love note left on Linda Evans’ pillow by Yanni when’s gone off to headline the Acropolis.</p><p>

What were they thinking? I won’t even get into the band’s choice of producer, Patrick Leonard, the brains behind Rod Stewart’s and Bryan Adams’ Unplugged albums. No, there are far greater crimes being committed here, from the sampling and ersatz electronica that dots “Wanted Dead Or Alive” and the Elton John-with-strings arrangement of “It’s My Life” to the Sheryl Crow-by-way-of-Bryan Adams (aha!) M.O.R. take on “Bad Medicine” and the bluesy, slide-guit strut that is the new/improved “You Give Love A Bad Name.” The latter, unfortunately, fails to do for Bon Jovi what an overhauled “Layla” did for Eric Clapton on his Unplugged album, namely, bring out previously-veiled nuances of an already classic tune while lending new emotional heft.</p><p>

Make no mistake, Bon Jovi is one of those bands that I’ve always respected, much to the chagrin of my fellow hacks. That said, in the liner notes guitarist Richie Sambora unintentionally fed me this review’s punchline when he remarked, “I don’t ever recall a band doing this.” Well no, Richie, I don’t recall  a band deliberately setting out to deep-six its artistic credibility either – Lou Reed doing Metal Machine Music doesn’t count – but hey, more power to ya. Even folks who attempt but fail at suicide eventually maintain simply by living on a prayer or two.</p><p>

BUMMER OF THE YEAR – ELLIOTT SMITH:
On the night of Tuesday, October 21, I got home from my shitty burger-flipping job, fixed up a nice big shot of dope, and then promptly passed out for about 12 hours. When I awoke the next morning word of rocker Elliott Smith’s suicide was all over the news (well, the music news venues – it was hardly a mainstream-worthy item). And I felt very, very bad…. Okay, the first part I just wrote isn’t true; I neither have a day job nor shoot dope. I’ve just always wanted to write something as pathetic as what a certain rock hack wrote roughly a decade ago in his self-serving Kurt Cobain eulogy. But I did feel bad when I got the news on Smith. I felt bad for his girlfriend (who found the body) and his associates (who no doubt had to clean up the bloody mess). I felt bad for all the fans who truly loved the man’s music, too; admittedly, Smith was not a major talent, but as with most overtly sensitive, nakedly autobiographical, occasionally hitting-the-mark singer-songwriters, he had a certain charisma that a lot of folks gravitated towards. And I felt bad for the many misguided kids who, like those waifs ‘n’ wastrels that earlier deified Cobain, will view Smith’s suicide through romantic, Hemingway-tinted glasses. If indeed this was a suicide; as I write some news reports have surfaced to cast possible doubt on that determination; details at 11. If it wasn’t suicide, as they used to say on Saturday Night Live, never mind – although it won’t change my opinion of suicide in general. Because as with most suicides, Smith’s act was the ultimate in narcissism and selfishness. May Smith, who betrayed the faith all his friends, family and fans had invested in him, rot in hell along with fellow junkie Cobain. They both surrendered their claims to heaven, of course, along with their claim to being worthy of our pity or veneration.</p><p>

UPPER OF THE YEAR:
Every parent has some oh-so-precious anecdote about their kid and music-hound parents are the worst. (“Do you know, at 6 months he was shaking his rattle in time with my favorite Ramones song…). I’m no different. A few nights before Christmas we were keeping warm around the fire and listening to a live radio broadcast of the Stained Souls (a Georgia supergroup of sorts featuring Col. Bruce Hampton, Tinsley Ellis, members of Widespread Panic and others). As they were shifting Willie Dixon’s classic “Spoonful” into serious high-choogle gear, I looked over and noticed that my 2-year old had sprung up and was half-jogging, half-dancing around the coffee table. Not particularly elegantly, mind you, more Joe Cocker than Fred Astaire. But without any trace of self-consciousness, oblivious to everything but the music and his private sense of cadence. I imagined myself as a kid, wondered what particular song or record kick-started my own musical journey upriver into the heart of the rock ‘n’ roll groove. Peering again at my son and looking at the beatific smile on his face, all I could think was, what a great Christmas gift. This year, young Eli received a guitar from Santa – hey, even an old guy like me can still dream, right?</p><p>

HERO OF THE YEAR:
U.S. Court Of Appeals (District Of Columbia) – for overturning, in December, a lower court's decision allowing the RIAA to file subpoenas against ISPs in order to force them to hand over names of alleged copyright violators (i.e., downloading pirates) The RIAA's argument, suggested the court, that the subpoenas allowed in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act would also apply to content stored with or transmitted via an ISP “borders upon the silly”.</p><p>

VILLAIN OF THE YEAR (1):
The RIAA (duh).</p><p>

VILLAIN OF THE YEAR (2):
Best Buy. I just never learn, do I? I didn’t have a villain category last year but of course anyone who read my comments knows my feelings on Best Buy. When I lived in Arizona I was used to instant access to new music (I worked in a record store)  but the record shopping is a little more complicated here in Asheville so I have to hit all the stores. Every time – I mean, every single time -- I try to find something that’s not, say, in the top 50 of the Billboard charts at Best Buy, my desire is thwarted. The stock selection is lousy and the staffers seem to have been hired directly from a deficient, GameBoy-scarred gene pool. I’m lured, of course, by the loss-leadering ads in the Sunday morning paper. Still.. to paraphrase those famous MasterCard commercials… Total savings while shopping at Best Buy: maybe a couple of bucks. Cost of gasoline, time and general angst in dealing with the clowns who stock the Best Buy bins: a whole fucking lot. Sticking with costlier but more reliable independent retailers in town and on the Web:  priceless.</p><p>
 
ROCK CRITIC OF THE YEAR (1):

Liz Phair, for her June 29 letter to the New York Times. Written as a parable and adapting the old “Chicken Little” tale, she attempted to answer all the haters who were claiming she’d sold out (true) and/or that her latest album sucked (even truer). Sample excerpt: “…as Chicken Little was poring over some back issues of other writers' material, she felt another idea about to form in her mind. ''Truth . . . no . . . Lies … no . . . ummm . . . ummm . . . Conspiracy!'' She was just about to write this down, when a great clattering and scraping began above her head. Clutching her PC to her 
breast, she swung her head wildly to and fro. ''The sky is falling! This time, the sky is falling! The sky is falling!''</p><p>

ROCK CRITIC OF THE YEAR (2):

Gina Arnold, for simultaneously biting the roccrit community hand that feeds her and writing about Liz Phair’s preposterously tacky new album in the July 16 issue of the East Bay Express. Arnold – who I’ve been a fan of in the past, make no mistake -- was heard straightfacedly comparing Liz to Elvis. The resulting gale force of laughter was felt from the bejeweled gates of Graceland to the gleaming girders of the Golden Gate Bridge – and across all the Internet crit-newsgroups in between. Sample excerpt: “Liz Phair has presented the world with a conundrum: a commercial record by an edgy artist. As such, it has created the greatest example of raging idiocy in rock criticism since the mainstream press decried Elvis Presley for wiggling his hips.”</p><p>

INTO THE AETHER:
Like most people, I’d anticipated Johnny Cash’s passing for a long time. It was when June Carter Cash died unexpectedly - the media accounts alone had been heartbreaking enough, husband Johnny at her bedside in the hospital, sending out a request to everyone to please pray for her recovery -- that I found myself pondering life and death, however. While my mother was still alive she was fond of saying, “You know you’re getting old when you dress to go to a funeral at least once a week.” And while many of us are terrified of confronting mortality, Mom didn’t seem to dread funerals. Having laid to rest both parents, a brother and her husband, she’d somehow learned, over the years, to navigate the emotionally un-navigable with the grace and reserve expected of a Southern woman. Would I ever accept death in such matter-of-fact terms? Intellectually, I wanted to think yes. But I just couldn’t shake the mental image of Johnny sitting in his Tennessee home, alone in the dark, grieving for June, maybe asking himself some of the same questions we were asking. He was the hard-living one, right? The one with the recent health problems? The impossibly frail-looking man in that video of his cover of Nine Inch Nails’ “Hurt”? The one who was supposed to go first? And I thought of my mother, upstairs in her room, alone with her TV shows, in the weeks after my father died. Did she ask any questions? Did she get any answers? Is that why she came to accept death with such grace and reserve?</p><p>


BYE-BYE, JOHNNY:
I met Johnny Cash once, in 1990, at a wrap party for the Tom Cruise race car flick Days Of Thunder (some friends of mine, the Belmont Playboys, were the house band that evening). Cash, along with June Carter Cash, Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter, had arrived as the guests of Cruise’s co-star Robert Duvall. I had to go shake his hand, saying to him, “Mr. Cash, I think you’re gonna like this band that’s fixing to play.” In that unmistakable deep baritone of his he replied, “Thank you son, I’m sure I will.” And – oh boy, by night’s end the entire posse – Johnny, Waylon, June, Jessi, even Duvall – were up onstage, taking turns at the mic and eventually leading the entire room in a group singalong for “Will The Circle Be Unbroken.” A night to tell the grandkids. Thanks, Mr. Cash – it sure sounded like you were enjoying the band.</p><p>

QUOTES (AS GIVEN TO ME) OF THE YEAR:</p><p>

Loretta Lynn (queen of country music), on The Dixie Chicks, George Bush, etc.: “Well, that was a thing that shouldn’t have been said. I’m gonna say what Mommy said to me. When I was growing up she said, ‘Loretta, if you’re gonna say something about somebody, make it good. If you can’t say anything good, don’t say nothing at all.’ Me and Crystal Gale and my sister Peggy Sue. We went politicking for George Bush the first. We only got to go one day, but we tore up Illinois, I’ll tell ya that. We rode this old school bus and we had a ball! You know, I had never done anything like that before. So we got into doing stuff like that and we loved it. Of course, George had us up there for a lot of reasons, you know. A lot of times it was just standing there, anything that was gonna go on, George had us there. And Jeb Bush, every time I see him and they’re saying something about him, it hurts me, because, you know, it’s like one of mine, my closest people. So like you said, if you can’t say nothing nice, don’t say nothing at all. What’s happened to people like that? I just don’t understand what it’s all about for this generation.”</p><p>

Jack White, on songwriting and authenticity: “The problem with a lot of modern music [is that] a lot of songwriters try to pretend that they just exist in a vacuum, that they have no influences. But the important part, if you’re calling yourself a musician or a songwriter, is to acknowledge the history of the songwriters and of the storytelling. Acknowledge who did it better before you. And if you’re doing anything interesting, to carry on that tradition, to carry those stories on. That’s what people don’t understand. A lot of musicians nowadays, if they’re at a party, say, with a bunch of aunts and uncles, and you said, ‘Hey, sit down at the piano and play us a song – you’re a musician, aren’t you?’ And they wouldn’t be able to do it, you know? ‘Oh, I need my amplifier and my effects pedals…’ That’s far from embracing the history of storytelling.”</p><p>

Robby Krieger (Doors guitarist), responding to accusations that he and founding Door Ray Manzarek, by touring as “The Doors Of The 21st Century” with The Cult’s Ian Astbury sitting in for the, er, notably absent Jim Morrison, are, at best, a tribute act and, at worst, an exercise in rank cynicism:  “I understand that. But you know, people are always gonna say that no matter what. There’s always gonna be people, the purists who are never gonna be satisfied until Jim comes back. [laughing]  I don’t think it’s gonna happen.”</p><p>

Mojo Nixon (Toadliquor, ‘80s MTV troubadour, now a DJ for a San Diego classic rock station), on his transition from indie-rock rabble-rouser to drive-time jock:  ”One thing I will say is that no one [from station management] has told me NOT to say something, and I’ve been saying some crazy shit. But between Howard Stern and Bill Clinton, the line is gone. I am in the belly of the beast now, the Clear Channel devil. And as you know, when you get in bed with the devil, he’s gonna fuck you in the ass! You can hold out for a little while, but eventually an ass-fucking is gonna take place. But yeah, I thought about it ten years ago that I should eventually do something else. I mean, I made 10 albums – isn’t that enough? [laughs] Plus, another one of my talents is just telling the truth real loud, drunkenly over a microphone, and nowadays, on the radio, I just blurt it out, and it gives me great joy and glee to blurt it out, to say that the emperor has no clothes. I get people calling me up saying, “Man, I never know what you’re gonna say. You’re saying the things we’re thinking but are afraid to say!”</p><p> 

Martin Slattery (Joe Strummer &amp; The Mescaleros multiinstrumentalist), on his late friend and bandleader: “Joe could have made hundreds of thousands of pounds guesting on other people’s albums, showing up for this, showing up for that, but he wouldn’t do any of it. He was about creating music for himself and for him to be able to perform and give to all the people. And the guy bore a lot. He took a lot of his shoulders: his band, his family, hundreds of thousands of people who he felt musically responsible to. He had a lot on his plate, and he dealt with it amazingly. He was one of the most naturally spiritual men I’ve ever met. You read books about Daoism and stuff like that, the way that it talks about going with your life – don’t fight what’s happening, move with the world. And obviously he fought it lyrically, but he was always cool, whatever went down. He moved and he talked with that humble authority. He [was] into the individual: You’ve gotta do what’s right for you. Which is another kind of Daoist principle. You’ve gotta follow what’s in your heart and not what’s in someone else’s heart. Tuning into your own spirit and whatever.  That’s what people should take from Joe. The fact that he came from what he did – at one point he was digging graves and at another part he was playing at Shea Stadium! That’s the spirit of an individual, and that’s what people need to carry with them, you know? I feel that very strongly. Again, in reference to the spiritual thing, that’s very much what that whole ethos is about. Finding – I don’t want to use the word “God” but I can’t think of another – the self within, the God within, and not someone else to rely on. And he did that, you know? It was incredible. That incredible energy that you get from that.”</p><p>
