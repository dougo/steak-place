A record that takes the listener from Iceland to a cracker barrel dumpster and finally to George Bush's ranch. "Early November we got back the plague". We shall see later this year. In the meantime, they live in the new economy where, as office drones, they slit their wrists with staplers and eat "twelve dozen donuts for lunch". Hey, they're better off than I am. At least they have a job.</li><li><a name="381"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#381"><strong>Belle and Sebastian</strong> <cite>Dear Catastrophe Waitress</cite> (Rough Trade/Sanctuary)</a><br />I don't know if Stuart Murdoch rediscovered his religion, but this rekkid has a lot of pep, which the last one, eh, did not have. Whether they're harassing the secretary, watching baseball, or telling us to thank God for "saving your sorry ass", the songs are endless charming. They don many stylistic hats here while still maintaining their twee presence. Their best yet.</li><li><a name="401"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#401"><strong>Fountains of Wayne</strong> <cite>Welcome Interstate Managers</cite> (S-Curve/Virgin)</a><br />Well, they've always been fun, and they've always been catchy. They just put it all together here, combining their best adolescent angst with those same kids facing their grown-up office years. I've said it before about their earlier stuff, but put this record in a time capsule, and everyone in the future will know what it was like to live at the turn of the century.</li><li><a name="402"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#402"><strong>Yo La Tengo</strong> <cite>Summer Sun</cite> (Matador)</a><br />This is how to grow old gracefully. Some folks found this record disappointing, too soft, not adventurous enough. Hmmm. Did anybody notice how EVERY SINGLE SONG is incredibly beautiful? Just wondering.</li><li><a name="125"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#125"><strong>Yeah Yeah Yeahs</strong> <cite>Fever to Tell</cite> (Interscope)</a><br />Karen O. often sounds like Chrissie Hynde, especially on the heartbreaking "Maps". Like the Pretenders, this debut full-length will likely be their best record. They also do jittery punk well. I love the way Karen O mimics the guitar line in "Pin". "Date With the Night" sounds so great mixed with the typical crap the local alternative station plays. It's all so exciting. I hope they can do it forever.</li><li><a name="57"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#57"><strong>Outkast</strong> <cite>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below</cite> (Arista)</a><br />Big Boi's disc is a very consistent high-quality rap/r&amp;b record. Lotsa classics there. Andre 3000's disc is a spotty, ambitious mess, and it has "Hey Ya!" and "Spread". So, you can have your Aesop Rock, but it ain't as good as this. No way.</li><li><a name="403"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#403"><strong>The Long Winters</strong> <cite>When I Pretend to Fall</cite> (Barsuk)</a><br />Comparisons to R.E.M. abound, and Peter Buck appears here, but Buck's adopted Northwest probably plays a more pivotal role. "Shapes" is a gem, sounding like a Built to Spill with country leanings. There are some weird ones, some alterna-ballads, some straightforward rockers. They're a litte bit country, a little bit punk-and-roll. R.E.M. hasn't made an album this good since they started saving for retirement.</li><li><a name="404"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#404"><strong>Kathleen Edwards</strong> <cite>Failer</cite> (Zoë/Rounder)</a><br />Ignored by too many, this is one of the best singer-songwriter records in ages. Canadian Edwards sounds like a sexier Sheryl Crow and her songs are as confessionally strong as Lucinda's.</li><li><a name="280"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#280"><strong>The Decemberists</strong> <cite>Catsways and Cutouts</cite> (Kill Rock Stars)</a><br />There were three records listed under their name this year, and this one is actually a re-release from last year. This is the best one. It has skewed pop like "July, July!", the epic multi-parted "California One Youth and Beauty Brigade", some subtle, folky Red House Painterly moments, and only occasionally do they sound like pretentious European street musicians.</li><li><a name="405"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#405"><strong>Richard Thompson</strong> <cite>One Thousand Years of Popular Music</cite> (Beeswing)</a><br />Only Thompson could really take something so momentous as a millenium of music, and make something so historically insightful and so much fun. From the 11th century right through Britney, the great guitarist and vocalist is your guide.</li><li><a name="315"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#315"><strong>British Sea Power</strong> <cite>The Decline of British Sea Power</cite> (Rough Trade/Sanctuary)</a><br />Starts off like Pixies circa _Surfer Rosa_ and then turns into Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, but not that pretentious and overdramatic. Almost, though. Solid tunes, and beats Interpol to a pulp.</li><li><a name="132"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#132"><strong>Dressy Bessy</strong> <cite>Dressy Bessy</cite> (Kindercore)</a><br />Didja like that last Apples in Stereo record _Velocity of Sound_? You did? Great! This is just like that, with a female singer. Fast, buzzing, hooky. Awesome.</li><li><a name="406"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#406"><strong>Adam Green</strong> <cite>Friends of Mine</cite> (Roght Trade/Sanctuary)</a><br />Ok, ok. Apparently there are some misguided souls who did not like that Moldy Peaches record. I hope you will one day see the light, my children. In the meantime, please pick up Adam Green's latest solo album. Adam was one half of Moldy Peahces, along with Kimya Dawson. This is apparently a better record than Adam's previous outings (I haven't heard them), and it is better than the one Kimya I have heard. Imagine if Lee Hazelwood made bedroom recordings enhanced by strings from some kick ass folks like Jane Scarpantoni. Oh yeah, in this scenario, Lee will be mainly singing about incestual love, and other such topics in a juvenile fashion. It works. Well, for me it does.</li><li><a name="124"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#124"><strong>The Thermals</strong> <cite>More Parts Per Million</cite> (Sub Pop)</a><br />This is one of those records where every song sorta sounds like the same song repeated over and over, but it's a really awesome song, and you always reach for this record, because it's filled with spit and piss, but is also very self-aware. "Hardly art/Hardly starving/Hardly art/Hardly garbage" they sing, really fast and angry like the indie world is crumbling.</li><li><a name="311"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#311"><strong>The Notwist</strong> <cite>Neon Golden</cite> (Domino)</a><br />I know this was originally released last year and garnered many votes from the chugchanga crowd, but I heard it for the first time this year, and technically this is a re-release with 3 completely useless bonus instrumental tracks! The rest of the songs, however, are actual songs, with quiet melodies, vaguely electronic, but using varied instrumentation. Nett, sehr nett. If it doesn't count, use #21.</li><li><a name="176"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#176"><strong>Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks</strong> <cite>Pig Lib</cite> (Matador)</a><br />The pretty boy from Pavement keeps up with the skewed lyrics, the rambling and the shambling. Occasional moments like a new wave number, or a "what-the-fuck" happen, just to keep us on our toes, while he winks.</li><li><a name="15"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#15"><strong>The New Pornographers</strong> <cite>Electric Version</cite> (Matador)</a><br />This is nowhere near as good as _Mass Romantic_, so just stop that right now. This time, they're a little too pleased with their words, and their hooks. However, they still have Neko Case, who sounds better in this context than she does on her own. They need to keep Neko Case.</li><li><a name="123"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#123"><strong>The Stokes</strong> <cite>Room on Fire</cite> (RCA)</a><br />It's funny. I was disappointed with _Is This It_ because there was so much advance hype, that when I actually heard the record, I agreed with its title (also, there is the fact that I bought the import, which had what I still consider their best song, "New York City Cops", and then they removed it post -9/11 for the domestic issue, which was just stupid. Since when did punk become polite?). So, now there is this record, and there is the anticipation, and then the advance word was that it sounded the same as the last record, no movement, no improvement. So (part 2), I had low expectations. It sounds like the last record. Turns out I like that sound.</li><li><a name="34"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#34"><strong>The White Stripes</strong> <cite>Elephant</cite> (V2)</a><br />Again, somewhat disappointing, but still better than most of the junk out there. The singles sounded great on the radio, and I love "There's No Home For You Here" which sounds like Zeppelin (and there is no Zeppelin anymore, folks), and "Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine" because I know a girl who has no faith in medicine. They seem to be getting worse, but they are still using their popularity to promote their art (I don't mean the beating up of guys in other garage bands), and we could have worse million sellers (and we do).</li><li><a name="131"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#131"><strong>Aislers Set</strong> <cite>How I Learned To Write Backwards</cite> (Slumberland/Suicide Squeeze)</a><br />The first time I listened to this I thought it was a piece of fluff. Catchy in spots, but disposable. Then it kept getting better. Now I think it's very catchy, and very smart.</li><li><a name="45"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#45"><strong>Cat Power</strong> <cite>You Are Free</cite> (Matador)</a></li><li><a name="291"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#291"><strong>Clem Snide</strong> <cite>Soft Spot</cite> (SpinART)</a></li><li><a name="407"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#407"><strong>The Delagados</strong> <cite>Hate</cite> (Mantra)</a></li><li><a name="408"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#408"><strong>Kaito U.K.</strong> <cite>Band Red</cite> (SpinART)</a></li><li><a name="409"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#409"><strong>The Ladybug Transistor</strong> <cite>The Ladybug Transistor</cite> (Merge)</a></li><li><a name="62"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#62"><strong>Lightning Bolt</strong> <cite>Wonderful Rainbow</cite> (Load)</a></li><li><a name="410"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#410"><strong>Mates of State</strong> <cite>Team Boo</cite> (Polyvinyl)</a></li><li><a name="252"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#252"><strong>The Pernice Brothers</strong> <cite>Yours, Mine &amp; Ours</cite> (Ashmont)</a></li><li><a name="136"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#136"><strong>Rainer Maria</strong> <cite>Long Knives Drawn</cite> (Polyvinyl)</a></li><li><a name="411"></a><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#411"><strong>The Stratford 4</strong> <cite>Love &amp; Distortion</cite> (Jetset)</a></li></ol><p>Honorable Mentions:<br /><br />
Teenage Fanclub - _Four Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty Seconds: A Short Cut to Teenage Fanclub_. A greatest hits record, and that's why I'm not including it in my votes, but song for song, probably the best record released this year.
<br /><br />
Stephin Merritt - _Pieces of April_. I had to get my fix this year somehow. This soundtrack is mostly made up of classic songs (and I do mean CLASSIC) from previous Magnetic Fields and 6ths records, but there are 4 new Magnetic Fields songs! They're all superb, of course.</p><hr /><a href="28.html">prev</a> | <a href="voters.html">list</a> | <a href="30.html">next</a></body></html>
