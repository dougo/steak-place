The songs lyrically don't seem to be about much beyond a certain feeling of
rebelliousness and lust, which in my mind is exactly the way it should be.
It clocks in at just past 30 minutes.  And I just can't stop playing it.  I
could try and explain why this is my favorite album of the year and the
Donnas don't even make my radar, but you'd probably just call me a
hypocrite.
</li><li><a name="don_lennon__downtown" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#don_lennon__downtown"><strong>Don Lennon</strong>, <cite>Downtown</cite> (Secretly Canadian)</a><br />An album that contains two songs about Dave Matthews mixed in with tunes
about Lenny Kravitz and gay nightlife doesn't necessarily sound like
sure-fire winner to me either.  But Don captures more humor and insight into
humanity with a few quick lines than most songwriters muster up in their
career.  It's irony-free irony, both fun and thought-provoking.  While not
as good as his previous disc "Maniac" it's more than good enough.
</li><li><a name="matt_pond_pa__green_fury" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#matt_pond_pa__green_fury"><strong>Matt Pond PA</strong>, <cite>The Green Fury</cite> (Polyvinyl)</a><br />For some reason Matt Pond discs take a few months to sink in.  Perhaps
that's why I'm tabbing this January release instead of his newest one.
There's always one enchanting hit beckoning for those initial repeat
listens, filled with warm cellos and yearning vocals.  Then one by one the
other tracks start to bubble through and from what was a song comes an album
that works beautifully from beginning to end.  I even love the crickets.
</li><li><a name="action__rolled_gold" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#action__rolled_gold"><strong>The Action</strong>, <cite>Rolled Gold</cite> (Reaction)</a><br />Usually I save the re-issues for a special category near the end, but this
one's too good to relegate to the end of this e-mail.  Plus, this album was
never officially released in the US until this year.  At least that's my
rationale.  The Action were an EMI band back in the 60's which caught the
fancy of the mods and nobody else (at least nobody who bought 45's).  In a
desperate attempt to stay on the label they recorded demos of this album,
for which they received a pink slip.  It vacillates between sharp pop,
amusing prog and breathtaking psych with simplistic repetitive lyrics.  But
somehow it all holds together.
</li><li><a name="josh_ritter__golden_age_of_radio" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#josh_ritter__golden_age_of_radio"><strong>Josh Ritter</strong>, <cite>The Golden Age Of Radio</cite> (Signature Sounds)</a><br />The majority of this album focuses on Josh ... his voice, his lyrics, his
guitar.  There's very little embellishment of these pretty country-folk
tunes, just a simple yet beguiling delivery and a couple of instruments.
The handful of full band tracks shine just as brightly, and in the end I'm
left wondering if their presence on the whole record would be an
improvement.  But I'm not one to quibble when an album is as good as this
one is.
</li><li><a name="montgolfier_brothers__world_is_flat" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#montgolfier_brothers__world_is_flat"><strong>Montgolfier Brothers</strong>, <cite>The World Is Flat</cite> (Poptones)</a><br />Brilliant debut albums are always hard to follow up, especially when they're
standard bearers of a certain style like the first Montgolfier Brothers
record.  Patient, repetitive, serene, crushing ... all adjectives that fit
perfectly with their retro 60's orch-pop style.  They never seem to expend
much energy yet somehow generate a potent charge.  On first listen this
sophomore release isn't as captivating as their previous effort, but over
time it settles into its own version of the formula and finds its own
slightly different path.
</li><li><a name="anniversary__your_majesty" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#anniversary__your_majesty"><strong>The Anniversary</strong>, <cite>Your Majesty</cite> (Vagrant)</a><br />Asserting that the latest Anniversary record is as good as ELO's New World
Record might not find it many fans.  But the elements are there, from the
sharp bouncy numbers to the pristine backing vocals to the bombast.
However, all of this is done with a more modern sensibility, trading
obscured vocals for an off-key delivery and monstrous keyboards for striking
guitars.  Strange that one kid described it as 'emo' to me.
</li><li><a name="rhett_miller__instigator" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#rhett_miller__instigator"><strong>Rhett Miller</strong>, <cite>The Instigator</cite> (Elektra)</a><br />There's still plenty of great power pop being produced out there, strange
that my favorite album in the genre this year is by the lead singer of the
Old 97's.  Though when you seen Jon Brion's name next to the producer credit
I suppose I should know what I'm in for ... after all that's why I purchased
the record.  And a fun romp it is, there are a couple of stunners, no real
letdowns and plenty of tunes about girls and other things he can't keep away
from.
</li><li><a name="windsor_for_the_derby__emotional_rescue_lp" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#windsor_for_the_derby__emotional_rescue_lp"><strong>Windsor For The Derby</strong>, <cite>The Emotional Rescue LP</cite> (Aesthetics)</a><br />Considering their penchant for instrumentals on previous releases I was
quite surprised to find an album full of ... well ... songs with lyrics.
While still occupying the space between math and slow-core, WftD added
vocals and found that they work better with instead of without.  The music
seems to carry more feeling (hence the title?), and one track in particular
sounds like dead-on early New Order.  I was surprised to find myself
branching out from that familiar starting point, eventually drawing
enjoyment from every track on the disc.
</li><li><a name="brett_rosenberg_problem__destroyer" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#brett_rosenberg_problem__destroyer"><strong>Brett Rosenberg Problem</strong>, <cite>Destroyer</cite> (Hi-Fi)</a><br />If the late 70's sounds of Joe Jackson, Cheap Trick or Nick Lowe don't
entrance you then you should probably let this one pass you by.  But if you
still reach out for that old copy of "I'm The Man" here's one of the best
knock-offs of that sound.  Filled with stinging guitar solos, howling
choruses and a short running time, this effort never failed to satisfy when
I had that rock-n-roll jones.
</li><li><a name="my_favorite__kids_are_all_wrong" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#my_favorite__kids_are_all_wrong"><strong>My Favorite</strong>, <cite>The Kids Are All Wrong</cite> (Double Agent)</a><br />I really didn't think My Favorite could top their debut album Love At
Absolute Zero, but if I combined their three follow-up ep's onto one disc it
just might do it.  New wave without being retro, My Favorite create gripping
situations in suburban bedrooms and bored classrooms, with a side-trip to
Hiroshima.  While the Smiths made you wonder how the heck you could continue
on, My Favorite plow through the mediocrity of life with their head down and
still somehow survive.  Joe Pernice once gave us the choice between graduate
school and suicide, My Favorite picked the former but still remember why
anyone would opt for the latter.
</li><li><a name="anna_waronker__anna" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#anna_waronker__anna"><strong>Anna Waronker</strong>, <cite>Anna</cite> (Five Foot Two)</a><br />If only for "I Wish You Well," though there are plenty of other deserving tracks.
</li><li><a name="brendan_benson__lapalco" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#brendan_benson__lapalco"><strong>Brendan Benson</strong>, <cite>Lapalco</cite> (Star Time)</a><br />It took him six years to put out another record, let's hope it's not another 6 until he follows up this gem.
</li><li><a name="arlo__stab_the_unstoppable_hero" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#arlo__stab_the_unstoppable_hero"><strong>Arlo</strong>, <cite>Stab The Unstoppable Hero</cite> (Sub Pop)</a><br />Mid-70's power pop with a bite.
</li><li><a name="beck__sea_change" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#beck__sea_change"><strong>Beck</strong>, <cite>Sea Change</cite> (DGC)</a><br />Really grown on me over the past few months.
</li><li><a name="sundays_best__californian" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#sundays_best__californian"><strong>Sunday's Best</strong>, <cite>The Californian</cite> (Polyvinyl)</a><br />If only for "Don't Let It Fade."
</li><li><a name="milky_wimpshake__lovers_not_fighters" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#milky_wimpshake__lovers_not_fighters"><strong>Milky Wimpshake</strong>, <cite>Lovers Not Fighters</cite> (Troubleman)</a><br />Reminds me of when punk could still be pop, humourous and political all at the same time.
</li><li><a name="mikabomb__fake_fake_sound_of_mikabomb" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#mikabomb__fake_fake_sound_of_mikabomb"><strong>Mikabomb</strong>, <cite>The Fake Fake Sound of Mikabomb</cite> (Damaged Goods)</a><br />I think it might have come out last year, though "Contact Tokyo" was a single this year.  Incomprehensible Japanese punk-pop.
</li><li><a name="moistboyz__iii" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#moistboyz__iii"><strong>Moistboyz</strong>, <cite>III</cite> (Ipecac)</a><br />If only for "I'm Gonna Kick Your Ass."  Though the whole thing smokes in a very similar way.
</li><li><a name="clientele__haunted_melody_7" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#clientele__haunted_melody_7"><strong>The Clientele</strong>, <cite>Haunted Melody 7"</cite> (Merge)</a></li></ol><p /><hr /><a href="39.html">prev</a> | <a href="voters.html">list</a> | <a href="35.html">next</a></body></html>
