<h3>DPVM -- The Dynamic Predicate Virtual Machine</h3>


The overall goal is to provide a high-level virtual machine as a
target for language implementation.  The main pieces of the system
so far are: 

<ol>
<li><b>DPVM</b> The dynamic predicate virtual machine.
<li><b>DPVML</b> A Scheme-like language, with first-class
types/predicates and set of primitives, that constitutes the "native"
programming language for the DPVM.
<li><b>MiniMMOO</b>
A Miniature Multi-Method Object-Oriented language.  Intended as a
simple example of using the dpvm as a target platform.
</ol>

There are two tracks in this project, as currently conceived:

<ol>
<li> To create a very high level virtual machine as a platform
on which to implement a range of languages, from Java to CLOS to
Aspect-Oriented (sub)languages.
<li>
Implementation techniques to efficiently execute applications
written on top of the virtual machine.
</ol>

DPVML (with a few changes in syntax) could be implemented easily
within a Scheme implementation as a bunch of functions.  The only
interesting built-in datatypes and functions in DPVML (so far) that
are not already in Scheme are predicates, routines to apply predicates
to values, and routines to decide predicate implication.  This is (or
at least would have been) the most straightforward way to play around
with implementing high level languages on the DPVM.
<p>
In fact, I reimplemented most of Scheme.  The only benefits from
implementing Scheme from scratch will come when the second track is
pursued -- when we want to apply techniques such as partial evaluation
and optimistic optimization to applications running on the DPVM.
