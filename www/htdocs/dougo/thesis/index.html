<HR><H1>Doug Orleans's Ph.D. Thesis</H1>

    <p>
      My Ph.D. thesis is going to be about programming language
      support for separation of concerns.  I am developing a language
      called
      <a href="http://socrates-lang.sourceforge.net/">Socrates</a> that extends
      <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/projects/cecil/www/Papers/gud.html">predicate dispatching</a>
      with <a href="http://aosd.net/">aspect-oriented</a> features.
    </p>

    <p>
      I submitted my thesis proposal to my Thesis Committee in April
      2002.  It is available as
      <a href="proposal.ps">PS</a>,
      <a href="proposal.pdf">PDF</a>,
      <a href="proposal.dvi">DVI</a>, or
      <a href="proposal.tex">L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X</a>
      (with <a href="proposal.bib">bibliography</a>).
      My comprehensive exam took place on Wednesday, May 22; my
      presentation slides are available as
      <a href="comprehensive.ps">PS</a>,
      <a href="comprehensive.pdf">PDF</a>,
      <a href="comprehensive.dvi">DVI</a>, or

    <h3>Some history:</h3>

    <p>
      In October of 1998 I submitted my plan of study, entitled
      <a href="plan/">Exploratory Programming with Collaborative Programming Languages</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In summer of 2000 I wrote a thesis proposal entitled
      <a href="000824/proposal/">A Next-Generation Collaborative Programming Language</a>,
      but before submitting it I decided I was probably biting off
      way more than I could chew, and needed to focus in on a narrower 
      thesis that would be easier to defend.
    </p>

    <p>
      In early 2001 I wrote a second thesis proposal,
      <a href="010125/proposal/">The Design and Implementation of Aspect-Oriented Languages</a>.
      Once again, before submitting it I realized that this wasn't
      really thesis-quality, so I went back to the drawing board.
    </p>

    <p>
      In October 2001 I wrote a paper about the relationship between
      AOP and predicate dispatching,
      <a href="../papers/aosd02/">Incremental Programming with
      Extensible Decisions</a>, which appeared at the
      <a href="http://trese.cs.utwente.nl/aosd2002.htm">1st International
	Conference on Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD)</a>,
      April 22-26, 2002, Enschede, The Netherlands.
      My <a href="/servlets/index.scm?d=dougo/thesis/011005/">third attempt at writing a thesis
      proposal</a> (which I never finished) was much the same as
      <a href="../papers/tr/02-01/">the submitted draft</a> (also
      known as Northeastern Tech Report NU-CCS-02-01).
    </p>
	
    <p>
      In February of 2002 I read
      <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/">Matthias Felleisen</a>'s
      paper from 1990,
      <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/scheme/pubs/scp91-felleisen.ps.gz">"On the Expressive Power of Programming Languages"</a>,
      which inspired my <a href="/servlets/index.scm?d=dougo/thesis/020313/">fourth attempt at 
      writing a thesis proposal</a>.  I was talked out of this idea
      because it was too different from what I had been working on,
      too difficult to complete in the allotted time, and ultimately
      not useful or interesting enough for a thesis.
