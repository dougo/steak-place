Introduction</A>
</H1>
<P>
Exploratory programming is an important part of the software
engineering cycle: when a domain is not very well understood or
open-ended, or it's not clear what algorithms and data structures
might be needed for an implementation, it's useful to be able to
interactively develop and debug a program without having to go through
the usual constraints of the edit-compile-run-debug cycle.  Many
languages provide support for exploratory programming via
interactivity, dynamicity, and extensibility, such as Lisp, Smalltalk,
Self, Obliq, Cecil, Dylan, and Python.  However, most exploratory
programming languages (and language environments) only allow a single
programmer to interact with the code and data being developed; if a
team of programmers wishes to collaborate, they must use project
management and revision control tools which greatly discourage or
hinder an exploratory style.  What I plan to study is how
language-level support for multiple programmers can enable exploratory
collaboration.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
History</A>
</H1>
<P>
My interest in collaborative languages stems from my extensive
experience with muds.  What started as a multi-user text adventure
game in 1979 has evolved into several varieties of multi-user
programmable virtual worlds.  The most popular (at least for non-game
uses) is MOO; it has been used for such widely varied purposes as
system administration[<A
 HREF="plan.html#remy">Eva93</A>], software process
modeling[<A
 HREF="plan.html#ACM-MOO">DHW98</A>], collaborative OO design[<A
 HREF="plan.html#CRC-MOO">HS95</A>],
collaborative astrophysics research [<A
 HREF="plan.html#AstroVR">VBBCN96</A>], telepresence
microscopy[<A
 HREF="plan.html#LabSpace">ZSE+96</A>], and distance
learning[<A
 HREF="plan.html#distance-learning">KLS+98</A>].  In fact MOO can be used to
implement almost any multi-user application, from web servers to
conferencing systems, and while the virtual world aspect of MOO is
useful for a number of these applications, I believe that the reason
for its success is its programming language, which enables and
encourages an exploratory method of collaborative programming.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Open Problems</A>
</H1>
<P>
From a programming language perspective, however, the MOO language has
some serious deficiencies.  While the system is technically
object-oriented, having objects that inherit fields and methods from
other objects, the high overhead of object creation and the lack of
automatic object garbage collection means that in practice most MOO
programs are not truly object-oriented; most data structures are
implemented using the built-in list type, while objects are used
solely for virtual-world entities (or prototypical parent objects of
these entities).  The lack of first-class functions further limits the
expressiveness of the language.  From my experience with mud
development, I believe that multiple inheritance and predicate
dispatch (a generalization of multiple
dispatch)[<A
 HREF="plan.html#predicate-dispatch">EKC98</A>] would greatly enhance the ability
for incremental development and code re-use in a collaborative
language as well.  MOO has fairly comprehensive facilities for the
introspection and invocation aspects of a meta-object
protocol[<A
 HREF="plan.html#MOP-tutorial">KP96</A>], but very little support for intercession,
i.e. allowing certain objects to override default behavior of the
object system, such as method dispatch or field update; I believe this
is another feature that is very important for exploratory programming.
Of course, the Demeter group here at Northeastern has studied a number
of approaches to encouraging evolution and re-use at the level of
collections of cooperating objects (e.g. adaptive plug-and-play
components[<A
 HREF="plan.html#APPC">ML98</A>]), and it would be fruitful to investigate these
ideas in the context of a collaborative language.
<P>
From a multi-user system perspective, MOO has some limitations as
well.  Chief among these is the fact that it only supports cooperative
multitasking; if a task uses more than a certain amount of time, or
performs more than a certain number of operations, without yielding,
then it is terminated with no recourse for cleanup.  True preemptive
multitasking would be much more powerful.  Another problem with MOO as
a multi-user system is the Unix-style security system; each field and
method has an owner and a set of flags for read and write permission.
A capability-based security system such as that discussed
in[<A
 HREF="plan.html#security-kernel">Ree96</A>] would be much more flexible and clean.  Other
areas of investigation include distribution and a more robust approach
to persistence-- MOO runs as a monolithic process which periodically
pauses to fork and dump a snapshot of its heap.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00040000000000000000">
Related Work</A>
</H1>
<P>
There have been a number of attempts to develop a collaborative
programming language, both within and without the context of a virtual
world system, with varying degrees of success.  ColdC[<A
 HREF="plan.html#Cold">Gil98</A>] adds
multiple inheritance, stronger encapsulation, lightweight objects, and
a simple module system, as well as a more database-oriented persistent
storage system.  SchMUSE[<A
 HREF="plan.html#SchMUSE">BCLZ93</A>] was a class-based distributed
delegation object system built on top of MIT Scheme.  Repo, used in
the COTERIE toolkit[<A
 HREF="plan.html#COTERIE">MF96</A>] adds replicated objects to
Obliq to support distributed interactive environments.
CL-HTTP[<A
 HREF="plan.html#CL-HTTP">Mal94</A>] is a hypermedia server allowing users to write
CGI scripts in Common Lisp.  Matrix[<A
 HREF="plan.html#Matrix">Sar98</A>] and POO[<A
 HREF="plan.html#POO">Str98</A>] are
projects attempting to add multi-user capabilities to Java and Python,
respectively.  Neverworld[<A
 HREF="plan.html#Neverworld">Hor98</A>] is a multi-user VRML world
built on top of (and allowing users programmatic access to) Scheme48.
Other collaborative language systems include MUQ, MudOS,
COOLmud, FMPL, and Mu; these and other links (including all the 
references in this paper) can be found on my resources web page,

Study Plan</A>
</H1>
<P>
For my Ph.D. thesis research I plan to investigate these systems in
greater detail, with a focus on studying how language-level issues
support collaborative exploratory programming.  This may lead to the
design and development of a new language, perhaps extending an
existing collaborative language or else adding multi-user support to
an existing exploratory language.  I then intend to perform some
experiments with users (perhaps based on the experiments in
[<A
 HREF="plan.html#SPARCL">Spr96</A>]) to determine just how well this type of system enables
exploratory collaborative programming, and how it compares both to
single-user exploratory programming and collaboration with traditional
tools.  I also plan to investigate some of the theoretical issues of
how best to formally model a collaborative language.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Fulfilling the course requirements</A>
</H1>
<P>
I have taken 6 classes since completing the Masters degree
requirements:
<UL>
<LI> COM 3205: Fundamentals of Software Engineering
<LI> COM 3230: Object Oriented Design
<LI> COM 3411: Knowledge-Based Systems
<LI> COM 3440: Natural Language Processing
<LI> COM 3480: Machine Learning and Neural Networks
<LI> COM 3830: Independent Project in Computer Science
</UL>
For the project course (with Prof.&nbsp;Clinger), I implemented the basics
of the BeCecil object system[<A
 HREF="plan.html#BeCecil">CL97</A>] in Scheme.  I received an
incomplete grade in the Machine Learning class, which I intend to
clear this quarter by finishing my project on explanation-based
learning.  In the fall&nbsp;'98 quarter, I am taking two readings courses
(COM 3800); one is a survey and feature comparison of collaborative
language systems, with Prof.&nbsp;Lieberherr, and the other is a study of
the formal semantics of MOO, with Prof.&nbsp;Wand.
<P><H1><A NAME="SECTION00070000000000000000">
Background</A>
</H1>
<P>
My minor area of study is artificial intelligence, having taken three
AI classes at NU.  Of particular note is a paper I wrote for the
Spring '98 quarter COM3411 class[<A
 HREF="plan.html#NL-VR">Orl98</A>]; this was an attempt to
develop a natural language system for muds that did both parsing and
generation using a unification grammar.  Much of the work I did on
JHCore (an object library for MOO) was related to natural language
generation from template messages set by the user.
<P>
For the past two years I have been working as a part of the Demeter
team on the implementation of the Demeter/Java
system[<A
 HREF="plan.html#UserManual">HLM+98</A>].  Prof.&nbsp;Lieberherr and I published a short
description paper in the proceedings of ICSE
1997[<A
 HREF="plan.html#preventive-maintenance">LO97</A>].
