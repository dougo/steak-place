Feature overview</A>
</H1>

<P>
In order to design a next-generation collaborative programming
language, I am studying current collaborative languages to see what
features I need to include and what needs to be improved.  What follows
is an overview of the basic features of some of the more widely-used
languages; my dissertation will include a more in-depth survey of the
features of these and other languages.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000"></A>
<A NAME="features"></A>
<BR>
Common features
</H2>
Before getting into the details of a particular collaborative
programming language, I will start with an overview of what the
languages I am studying have in common.  First of all, by definition,
they allow multiple programmers to collaborate.  In practice, this
means that they act as servers, accepting input from multiple network
sockets asynchronously, and allow code (i.e.&nbsp;behavior) to be added or
modified dynamically based on this input.  (A digression: the features
I discuss may appear to be features of a programming language
<I>environment</I>, rather than of a programming language; however, the
line between the two is often blurred, even in more mainstream
languages-- the interactive environment is fairly integral to the
Smalltalk and Lisp families of languages, and the Java language
specification covers the class loading process in detail.  More
importantly, however, a collaborative programming language typically
<I>reifies</I> the concept of the programmer into a structure that is
part of the semantics of the language, so features that usually are
part of the environment really are part of the language.)  This
feature, asynchronous dynamic behavior modification, requires a number
of other features: type safety and garbage collection, so that a wild
pointer or memory leak caused by one programmer can't cause the whole
server to crash; multitasking and resource control, so that one
programmer's code can't monopolize the server by, for instance,
running a tight infinite loop; persistence, so that the programmers
don't have to re-upload all their code when the server is shutdown and
restarted; and reflection, so that programmers can examine the code
that's already on the server (their own or others').

<P>
Another feature that collaborative programming languages usually have
is security: a programmer owns code and data that he creates, and can
control access to it; however, while this can be useful for enforcing
abstraction barriers (much like access control in other languages,
e.g. the <TT>private</TT>, <TT>protected</TT>, and <TT>public</TT>
keywords in C++ and Java), it is not strictly necessary for
collaboration, and is often not used at all.  Collaborative
programming languages are often (perhaps predominantly) used in
another setting than collaboration, though, which I will call
<I>community programming</I>: programmers share code and data dynamically,
yet they may not always be collaborating in the sense of working
towards a common goal, and in fact may not trust each other at all; in
this situation, access control mechanisms are essential.

<P>
The collaborative programming languages I am studying share another
feature that is not essential to collaboration: they are all
single-dispatch classless object-oriented languages.  That is, they
have objects, which have fields and methods, and which may inherit
fields and methods from other objects.  These languages are probably
object-oriented because they were designed for the multi-user
simulation environment domain, and OO languages are well suited for
simulations; the fact that they are all also classless may be
coincidence, but it may also be due to the dynamicity properties of
the language: it's easier to modify a field or method on an object,
which is dynamically inherited by the object's descendant objects,
than it is to modify a field or method on a class and update all the
instances of the class.  Interestingly, recent versions of several of
these languages have added mechanisms that can simulate the
class-instance relation.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">
MOO</A>
</H2>

<P>
The MOO programming language is idiosyncratic in that it is a mud
language, and its terminology reflects that fact: users are called
<I>players</I>, super-users are called <I>wizards</I>, object
methods are called <I>verbs</I> (because they are used to execute
the verbs in commands, such as <TT><TT><B>look</B></TT> in
mirror</TT>, <TT><B>get</B> key</TT>, or <TT><B>put</B> book on
shelf</TT>), and object fields are called <I>properties</I>.  There are
also a number of aspects to the language that are irrelevant to a
general-purpose collaborative programming language: for example, all
objects have <TT>name</TT>, <TT>location</TT>, and <TT>contents</TT>
properties, and all user input is processed by default by a command
parser that tries to match words in the command to objects in the same
location as the player.  In general I will ignore mud-specific aspects
of the language in this paper, but occasionally they have an impact on
other parts of the language.

<P>
All program code in MOO lives in the verbs; there are no global
functions or static code blocks.  The MOO server has a built-in
command for programming a verb that accepts the code of the verb
terminated by a single period on a line by itself.  Typically
programmers can also evaluate single expressions or sequences of
statements with an <TT>eval</TT> command.  The syntax is somewhat
similar to C++ or Java, with semicolon-terminated statements and infix
arithmetic; object properties are referenced with a dot,
e.g.&nbsp;<TT>player.name</TT>, while verbs are invoked with a colon,
e.g.&nbsp;<TT>player:name()</TT>.  The server provides a set of
<I>builtin functions</I> (analogous to system calls) which are
invoked as if they were global functions,
e.g.&nbsp;<TT>notify(</TT><I>p</I><TT>,&nbsp;"Hello,&nbsp;world!")</TT> sends the
string ``Hello,&nbsp;world!'' to player <I>p</I>'s connection.  Variables
are untyped and do not need to be declared ahead of time; using a
variable before it has been initialized results in a ``Variable not
found'' exception.  There are no formal named arguments to a verb;
instead a single special variable <TT>args</TT> holds the list of
actual arguments used in the verb invocation.  Scattering assignment
can be used (as in perl) to assign the arguments to a list of
variables, e.g.&nbsp;<TT>{a,&nbsp;b,&nbsp;c}&nbsp;=&nbsp;@args</TT>.  Other special variables
include <TT>this</TT>, which is the receiver object of the
current verb invocation, just like in C++ or Java 
(<TT>this</TT> must be explicitly used when referring to properties
and verbs on the current object);
<TT>caller</TT>, which is what the value of <TT>this</TT> was when the
current verb was invoked; and <TT>player</TT>, which by default is the
player who entered the command currently executing (but the value of
<TT>player</TT> can be changed by a verb running with wizard
permissions--see the paragraph on security below).

<P>
As mentioned in the overview, MOO is a single-dispatch classless
object-oriented (sometimes referred to as object-based) language.
Objects inherit from each other, singly; thus, each object has a
parent, and when a verb or property is referenced on an object, if
it's not defined on that object, the object's parent is searched.  A
verb can call the builtin function <TT>pass()</TT> to re-send the
current verb call to the object's parent.  [TBD: discuss property
inheritance and clear properties] Each object has a unique
fixed integer associated with it, known as its <I>object number</I>,
or <I>objnum</I>; all objects can be referred to in code with a
literal objnum expression <TT>#</TT><I>objnum</I>.  Objnums are
assigned at object creation time in increasing order starting with
<TT>#0</TT> 
for the system object.  A shorthand exists for referring to properties 
and verbs on the system object: <TT>$foo</TT> is equivalent to
<TT>#0.foo</TT>, and <TT>$bar(x,&nbsp;y)</TT> is equivalent to
<TT>#0:bar(x,&nbsp;y)</TT>.  This allows for a global namespace of sorts;
a useful object can be given a name by adding a property to
<TT>#0</TT> with the object as its value, so that, e.g.,
<TT>$player</TT> can be used to refer to the generic player object
that is used as the parent of all player objects.

<P>
Objects are not garbage-collected; objects must be deleted explicitly.
Objnums referring to deleted objects (as well as negative objnums) are
referred to as <I>invalid</I>.  Deletion of objects leaves ``holes''
at these invalid objnums; there is a <TT>renumber()</TT> builtin
function that reassigns an object's number to be the lowest
nonnegative invalid objnum, but this is not used in practice (except
in special cases) because it does not fix existing references to the
object's old number (in properties or in verb code).  Instead, the
custom is to never actually delete an object, but to strip all verbs
and properties from it and put it onto a free list of ``garbage''
objects that can be reused when new objects are needed.

<P>
There are other, non-object values in MOO, such as integers, strings,
and lists; list values are immutable heterogenous arrays and are
garbage-collected, using a simple reference-counting scheme.  Lists
are often used for data structures, because objects are heavyweight,
both conceptually and in time and space overhead, due to the cost of
recycling and the allocation of builtin properties such as name and
location that are only useful for objects representing virtual
entities.  A recent experimental extension to the language adds a new
value called <I>waifs</I>; this extension in essence treats normal
MOO objects as classes, with waifs acting as instance objects.  Each
waif value has a class (an objnum) and a list of values corresponding
to its class's list of defined properties.  Verbs are invoked on waifs
just as they are on objects, by dynamically looking up the class's
inheritance chain; waifs cannot define their own verbs or properties.
Waifs, like lists, are garbage-collected, but are mutable, like
objects, providing the best of both worlds, although the current
implementation imposes the limitation that circular waif structures
cannot be created, so that reference-counting garbage collection can
still work.

<P>
MOO is single-threaded, but has multitasking; each command received
from a player starts a task, and additional tasks may be created with a
<TT>fork...endfork</TT> statement.  Task switching is done
cooperatively: a task may surrender control to other tasks for a given
minimum number of seconds <I>n</I> (which may be&nbsp;0) by calling the
builtin function <TT>suspend(</TT><I>n</I><TT>)</TT>; a suspended task may be
resumed before its time by calling the builtin function
<TT>resume(</TT><I>id</I><TT>)</TT>, where <I>id</I> is the task-id of the
suspended task (a unique integer).  The
<TT>read(</TT><I>p</I><TT>)</TT> builtin function also
suspends the current task, resuming when a line of input has been read
from player <I>p</I>'s connection.  In order to prevent a task from
monopolizing the server by not suspending, however, the server
interrupts a task if it has run for more than a certain amount of time
or number of instructions (<I>ticks</I>); the default threshold
amounts are 5 seconds and 30,000 ticks (for command tasks), which can
be overridden by setting special properties on the system object
(<TT>#0</TT>).  When a task is interrupted by the server, an
uncatchable exception is thrown and printed to the player who typed
the command that created the task (this behavior can also be
overridden by adding a special verb to the system object).  Usually, a
task that has a loop that might run a large number of times will call
the builtin function
<TT>ticks_left()</TT> each time through the loop to determine whether
it needs to suspend.

<P>
In addition to time restrictions on a task, the amount of space used
by a player can be restricted; if a property named
<TT>ownership_quota</TT> exists on a player, then when that player
calls the builtin function <TT>create()</TT> to make a new object, the
value of the property is decremented by one if it's positive, or else
a ``Resource limit exceeded'' exception is thrown.  The value is
likewise incremented whenever an object is destroyed with the
<TT>recycle()</TT> builtin function.  (If a ``garbage'' list is used
as described above, this value can also be adjusted whenever objects
are added to or removed from the list.)  The builtin function
<TT>object_bytes()</TT> can also be used to measure the size of an
object, if a more finer-grained quota policy needs to be implemented.
There are also restrictions on the number of nested verb calls in a
task stack and the number of forked or suspended tasks owned by any
one player.

<P>
The heap of allocated objects is known as the <I>database</I>, or
<I>db</I>, although the db does not have much resemblance to a
conventional database; the db is kept entirely in memory in a single
process, and must be periodically checkpointed by calling the
<TT>dump_database()</TT> builtin function, which saves
the db to disk in a format that can be reloaded if the system needs to
be restarted after being shut down (or crashing).  A version of the
MOO server called LPMOO is implemented on top of another mud server,
DGD (in its language, LPC), which itself provides more continuous
persistence, as well as smaller process size, by keeping all objects
on disk and loading them into memory only when needed; only the
working set of cached objects need be written to disk when
checkpointing, which can then be done more often since it's much
faster.

<P>
There are a number of builtin functions that provide reflective
capabilities.  For introspection, there are builtin functions to
determine an object's parent, its children, its defined properties or
verbs, or whether an object is a player object; there are builtin
functions to inspect a property or verb definition's name, owner, and
permission flags (see next paragraph), or about a builtin function, or
to retrieve a verb's code; and there are builtin functions to get the
list of player objects, the maximum object number, or the list of
currently queued tasks.  For invocation, there are builtin functions
to change an object's parent, to make an object a player or not a
player, to add or delete a property or verb from an object, to set a
property or verb definition's name, owner, or permission flags, or to
set the code of a verb; there are also builtin functions to call a
builtin function given its name in a string, or to evaluate an
arbitrary expression given in a string.  In addition, properties can
be referenced using a computed name with special syntax,
e.g.&nbsp;<TT>obj.(propname)</TT> will read the property whose name is the
value of <TT>propname</TT> (which must be a string) on the object
<TT>obj</TT>; verbs can be invoked with a similar syntax,
e.g.&nbsp;<TT>obj:(verbname)()</TT> will invoke the verb whose name is the
value of <TT>verbname</TT> on the object <TT>obj</TT>.  There is a
limited form of intercession, as well: whenever a builtin function
<I>fun</I> is called, if there is a verb on the system object whose
name is <TT>bf_</TT><I>fun</I>, it is invoked instead.  There is no
way to intercede on a property reference or a verb invocation,
however.

<P>
Security in MOO is accomplished with a simplified Unix-style
permission system.  Tasks always run with the permissions of a single
player, similar to the effective user id of a process in Unix.  Every
object, verb, and property has an owner and <TT>r</TT> and <TT>w</TT>
flags that determine if tasks running with permissions other than the
owner (or a wizard) can read or write them.  Each object also has an
<TT>f</TT> flag (``fertile'') that determines if tasks running with
permissions other than the owner may create children of the object.
Each verb also has an <TT>x</TT> flag that determines if tasks running with
permissions other than the owner can execute it.  However, verbs
always run with the permission of the owner of the verb, rather than
the permissions in effect when the verb is invoked, so that a verb
owned by a player can always access properties owned by that player as
well.  This is the reverse of the normal Unix case; it is as if all
programs in Unix had their set-user-ID bit on.  [TBD: <TT>c</TT> flag on
properties] Tasks running with wizard permissions, i.e.&nbsp;verbs owned by
wizards, can call
<TT>set_task_perms(</TT><I>p</I><TT>)</TT> to change the current
task's permissions to player <I>p</I>; this is often used to run
with the caller's permissions, by setting them to the value of the
builtin function <TT>caller_perms()</TT>.  Tasks running with wizard
permissions may also change the value of the special variable
<TT>player</TT>, in order to simulate a command being sent by another player 
than the one who actually sent it.  A number of builtin functions are
restricted to act only on objects, verbs, or properties owned by the
current permissions, unless the current permissions are those of a
wizard, such as <TT>chparent()</TT> and <TT>recycle()</TT>; others
may only be with wizard permissions, such as <TT>dump_database()</TT>
or <TT>shutdown()</TT>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00023000000000000000">
ColdC</A>
</H2>

<P>
ColdC (originally called C<IMG
 WIDTH="32" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.gif"
 ALT="$-$">) is a successor to MOO, and so shares
many of MOO's features, improving on some of them.  The main
innovation was the removal of all mud-specific features, creating a
true general-purpose collaborative programming language.  The ColdC
server (or <I>driver</I>), Genesis (originally called Coldmud), does
not attempt to parse commands, nor does it maintain location and
contents; even security features have been almost completely removed.
The intention is that all of these features can (if desired) be
implemented on top of the base functionality that the language
provides.  Terminology is more in line with traditional OO languages:
users are called users and methods are called methods; fields are
called <I>object variables</I>.

<P>
ColdC syntax is more like C++ than MOO is: both object variable and
method reference is done with dot (<TT>foo.bar</TT> or
<TT>foo.bar()</TT>), and object variables on the current object may be
referred to by simply naming them (i.e. no explicit <TT>this</TT>
needed); local variables must be declared at the top of a method
(though there is still no static typing); method parameters are named;
block structure can be provided with curly braces.  Invoking a method
on the current object can be written as <TT>.foo()</TT>; the dot is
still necessary to avoid ambiguity with functions (the ColdC term for
what MOO calls builtin functions).  There are no special variables;
instead, functions are used: <TT>this()</TT> returns the current receiver
object, <TT>definer()</TT> returns the object that defines the current method
(which is always an ancestor of <TT>this()</TT>), <TT>sender()</TT>
returns the object that invoked the current method, and
<TT>caller()</TT> returns the object that defines the method that
invoked the current method (an ancestor of <TT>sender()</TT>).  The
function <TT>user()</TT> simply returns whatever was passed to the
last call to <TT>set_user()</TT> on the current object; the intention 
is similar to the <TT>player</TT> special variable in MOO, i.e.&nbsp;to
keep track of the originating object for the current task, but the
driver does not do anything special to set or maintain it.

<P>
The ColdC object model has multiple inheritance; method inheritance
uses depth-first search up the parents list, from left to right,
skipping parents it has already searched due to inheriting
the same parent via multiple paths.  The <TT>pass()</TT> function
re-sends to the next method that would be found in the current method
invocation, i.e.&nbsp;it might not always be an ancestor of
<TT>definer()</TT>.  Objects have unique numbers, as in MOO, which are 
referred to with the syntax <TT>#</TT><I>objnum</I>; they also have
unique alphanumeric names, which are referred to with the syntax
<TT>$</TT><I>name</I>.  Object names can be changed with the
<TT>set_objname()</TT> function, but this should be done with care as 
methods with literal references to the old name will not be
updated.<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot153"><SUP>1</SUP></A>
<P>
Similar to MOO, objects in ColdC are not garbage collected, but there
is a lightweight object data structure similar to the waifs extension
to MOO, called a <I>frob</I>.  Unlike waifs, however, frobs are
immutable, which somewhat limits their utility.

<P>
ColdC has cooperative multitasking, similar to MOO.  Atomic mode can
be turned on with the function <TT>atomic()</TT>, which prevents any
other tasks from running until atomic mode is turned off; a task
running in atomic mode is also immune to the tick limit.  The creation
functions do not enforce any sort of quota policy, but one can be
implemented in ColdC using the <TT>bind_function()</TT> function (see
the next paragraph below).  Genesis is disk-based, i.e.&nbsp;it keeps all
objects on disk and only loads them into memory when needed; however,
tasks are not persistent and must be manually saved in a restartable
format if they need to stay around after the system is restarted.
Reflection in ColdC is similar to MOO, but with no intercessory
capabilities and no <TT>eval()</TT> function.

<P>
ColdC has no notion of task permissions such as MOO has; however, it
allows C++/Java style access control for methods, using the keywords
<TT>public</TT>, <TT>protected</TT>, and <TT>private</TT>, and it is a 
runtime error to call protected or private methods from outside the
object.  There are three additional access control keywords:
<TT>root</TT>, which means a method may only be called by the
<TT>$root</TT> object; <TT>driver</TT>, which means a method may only
be called by the driver; and <TT>frob</TT>, which means a method may
only be called with a frob as the receiver.  All object variables are
considered to be private, i.e.&nbsp;only the defining object may access its 
object variables.  Functions (e.g.&nbsp;administrative functions like
<TT>shutdown()</TT>) can be
protected by using the <TT>bind_function(</TT><I>fun</I><TT>,
</TT><I>obj</I><TT>)</TT> function to only allow the <I>fun</I>
function to be called from methods defined on <I>obj</I> (typically
<TT>$sys</TT> or <TT>$root</TT>).  This can be used to force access
to functions to go through methods, which can impose extra security or
resource control measures.  A method may also be set
<TT>nooverride</TT>, which means that no descendant object may define a 
method with the same name; this can prevent spoofing of secured
methods.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00024000000000000000">
LPC/DGD</A>
</H2>

<P>
LPC is the language for LPMUD, a descendant of the original MUD that
evolved in parallel to MOO without much cross-breeding.  DGD
(Dworkin's Generic Driver) is the latest LPC driver, which, like
Genesis/ColdC, is a general-purpose collaborative programming language
because it doesn't include any mud-specific features.  Its syntax is
almost identical to C, including statically typed variables but not
including pointers (but objects, strings, arrays, etc. are passed by
reference, similar to Java).  The database consists of a Unix-style
hierarchical file system; each object corresponds to a file whose name
ends in <TT>.c</TT>, e.g.&nbsp;<TT>/system/driver.c</TT>, which contains
the source code for the object variables and functions.  A literal
object reference is simply a string containing the source filename of
the object (without the <TT>.c</TT>).  Calls to functions in other
objects are done C++-style, i.e.&nbsp;<TT>obj-&gt;fun()</TT>.  Driver
functions are called <I>kfuns</I> (kernel functions) and are
called the same way as functions in ColdC or MOO.  The kfuns
<TT>this_object()</TT>, <TT>previous_object()</TT>, and
<TT>previous_program()</TT> play the roles of ColdC's
<TT>this()</TT>, <TT>sender()</TT>, and <TT>caller()</TT>,
respectively.  An object can (multiply) inherit from other objects
using <TT>inherit </TT><I>obj</I><TT>;</TT> declarations.  A
function can re-send to a function on its parent using
<TT>::</TT><I>fun</I><TT>()</TT>.  Directed re-send is accomplished
by providing a tag in the <TT>inherit</TT> declaration and using the
tag, e.g.&nbsp;the declaration <TT>inherit p2 "/foo/bar";</TT> allows
re-sends to the object <TT>"/foo/bar"</TT> with the expression
<TT>p2::</TT><I>fun</I><TT>()</TT>.

<P>
LPC objects are not garbage collected, but arrays and other data
structures are.  Something similar to waifs and frobs exists, called
<I>clones</I>: instead of inheriting an object by making a new
object file with an <TT>inherit</TT> declaration, you can call the
kfun <TT>clone_object()</TT>, which makes a new copy of an object.  A
clone cannot itself be cloned or inherited from, but is otherwise like 
a regular object.  When an object is modified and reloaded (with the
kfun <TT>compile_object()</TT>), all of its clones are modified as
well, keeping the same values for variables whose definition did not
change.  Clones are assigned names in the file system, based on the
name of the object it was cloned from and a unique number, e.g.&nbsp;a
clone of an object named <TT>/foo/bar</TT> will be named something
like <TT>/foo/bar#1234</TT>.  Since clones are always accessible by
name with a literal object name expression, they are not garbage
collected.

<P>
LPC has cooperative multitasking, similar to MOO and ColdC.  The
resources (maximum stack depth and number of ticks) available to a
block of code can be specified with a
<TT>rlimits(</TT><I>depth</I><TT>, </TT><I>ticks</I><TT>) {</TT>
...<TT>}</TT> construct.  DGD is disk-based, similar to Genesis.
Reflection is similar to MOO, although introspection is mainly done at 
the object level rather than the level of functions and object
variables.  (The exception is the kfun <TT>function_object()</TT>,
which determines which inherited object provides a given function.)
There is no <TT>eval()</TT> function.  Intercession is achieved through 
a number of hooks that are called on the driver object (similar to the
system object in MOO or ColdC); of particular note is
<TT>call_object()</TT>, which is called whenever an object calls a
function on another object--neither MOO nor ColdC has intercession on 
method calls.  In addition, kfuns can be shadowed (and new ones added) 
in the root object, called the <I>auto</I> object, similar to
<TT>#0:bf_</TT><I>fun</I> wrappers in MOO.

<P>
LPC's approach to security is similar to ColdC's: access to functions
and variables is controlled with keywords such as <TT>private</TT> and
<TT>static</TT> (similar to <TT>protected</TT> in other languages),
and all other access control must be implemented in the database
(with the intercessory driver hooks, as opposed to restricting access
to kfuns as is done in ColdC).  The keyword <TT>nomask</TT> serves the 
same purpose as ColdC's <TT>nooverride</TT>.
