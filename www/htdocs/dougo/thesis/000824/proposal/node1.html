Introduction</A>

<P>
Computer programming is seldom a solitary effort--many projects are
just too big for one person to implement, and even smaller projects
can often be done faster with multiple developers.  The usual approach
to multi-developer programming is to use collaborative tools such as a
version control system to facilitate the exchange of source code.  An
alternate approach, however, is to use a programming language that
itself supports the concept of multiple programmers collaborating on a
project.  Several such languages exist, such as MOO[??], ColdC[??],
and LPC[??]; however, since they were written as descendants of
MUD[??], a multi-user text adventure game (and now referred to
generically as <I>muds</I>), they were designed by hobbyists who had
little background in programming language design or theory, and thus
are somewhat clumsy and ill-suited for applications outside the domain
of muds (and in some ways are even inadequate for the mud domain
itself).  Many ambitious projects have been successfully implemented
using them, however, even outside the domain of muds, demonstrating
that the idea of collaborative programming languages is a useful one.
Little substantial progress has been made in this area over the last
seven years; this indicates that some plateau had been reached, where
the languages had matured to an expressiveness that was suitable
enough for widespread use.  I believe, however, that there are still
significant improvements to be made in the design of collaborative
programming languages.  For my dissertation I will explore some of
these possibilities, designing and implementing a prototype language
that is suitable for fleshing out into a next-generation collaborative
programming language.  Along the way I will attempt to bring some
academic rigor to the area, surveying and comparing existing languages
and developing semantics for ``featherweight'' subsets of them (in the
manner of FJ[??]) as a basis for further study.  The rest of this
paper presents a feature overview of the most prominent collaborative
programming languages, an evaluation of their advantages and
shortcomings, a description of my current design for BOB, a classless
object-oriented language embedded into Larceny[??] (a Scheme
implementation) that supports collaborative programming, and finally
an outline of my plan for completing the dissertation.  Included as an
appendix is a presentation of the formal syntax and semantics for FM
(Featherweight MOO).
