BOB: A prototype collaborative language</A>
</H1>
One approach to implementing a collaborative language would be to
embed mechanisms for collaboration in an existing single-programmer
language.  Dynamically extensible languages such as Lisp or Smalltalk
and their descendants would be best suited for this.  This approach
gives all the benefits of a full-featured general purpose language
more or less for free; for example, you could write a simple program
in CLOS that accepted connections on a socket and attached a
read-eval-print loop to each connection in a separate thread, along
with a small library of functions for publishing values to other
connections' environments, and you would have a collaborative
programming language with all the features described in section
<A HREF="node3.html#features">2.1</A> except for resource control and security.
Unfortunately, these two are very difficult to integrate with an
existing language; for example, one can easily circumvent Common
Lisp's module encapsulation and reference an internal symbol in
another package by simply using two colons (i.e. ``foo::bar'').
One would have to write secure, multi-programmer-aware versions of
practically every function in the CLOS library.  [TBD: explain this a
little better- e.g. find-class]

<P>
[TBD: talk about Java, JRes, security, but class loading is not
incremental enough]

<P>
An alternate approach is, of course, to implement a new language from
scratch.  This has the advantage of complete control over the
features; security and incremental update can be designed in from the
start.  It is also a good approach for pedagogical reasons: you can
define a very clean, simple prototype language without needing to deal 
with all the issues that would be required for a full-featured
practical language but are irrelevant to a collaborative programming
language.  However, even just implementing the features described in
section <A HREF="node3.html#features">2.1</A> is quite a task!  Multitasking and persistence, 
in particular, can be very tricky to implement, and while they are
(practically speaking) required for a collaborative programming
language, their implementation has little to do with the
collaborative-ness.  (More importantly, I just don't have the
expertise needed to implement them in the time frame of my PhD!)

<P>
What I've decided on is a hybrid approach that gives me much of the
best of both worlds.  I have begun to implement a prototype language
embedded in Larceny, an implementation of Scheme created by Lars
Hansen, a fellow doctoral student at Northeastern.  Scheme's biggest
advantage over Common Lisp is that environments are truly encapsulated
[TBD: back this up!] and can serve as the basis of a simple security
kernel, as Jonathan Rees has outlined [??].  The advantage of the
Larceny implementation is that it provides multithreading and
persistence (in the form of heap dumping and loading), as well as
support for first-class environments.  So far, I've mainly
concentrated on building an object system in Larceny suitable for a
collaborative programming language; I decided to base it on the
untyped subset of BeCecil, a simplified version of Cecil whose
semantics are specified in [??], hence the (working) name ``BOB'',
which stands for ``Based On BeCecil''.

<P>
The BOB object system is, like BeCecil, centered around generic
functions (also known as multimethods) similar to those in CLOS and
Dylan.  It also provides a multiple-dispatch version of instance
variables called storage tables, elegantly unifying fields and methods
into the same lookup mechanism.  Unlike BeCecil, however, everything
is dynamically modifiable; methods and storage tables can be added to
or deleted from generic functions, and the object inheritance relation
can be mutated, all at runtime.  Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="node8.html#bob-syntax">1</A> summarizes
the core syntax of BOB.

<TT>define-object</TT> defines an object in the current lexical scope
with the given name and parent(s).  If no parents are specified, the
new object inherits directly from <TT>&lt;object&gt;</TT>, the root of the
inheritance hierarchy.

<P>
<TT>define-gf</TT> defines a generic function in the current lexical
scope with the given name.  Methods, acceptors, and storage tables
(collectively known as <I>handlers</I>) can be attached to generic
functions by side-effect with <TT>add-method!</TT>,
<TT>add-acceptor!</TT>, and <TT>add-storage!</TT>.  Each formal
argument of a handler has a specializer object (which defaults to
<TT>&lt;object&gt;</TT> if not provided); the specializers of the handlers are
used when determining what handler is used when a generic function is
called.  There are two ways to call a generic function:
<I>invoking</I> and <I>assigning</I>.  Correspondingly, each
generic function has two lists of handlers, its <I>invocables</I>
and its <I>assignables</I>; methods attached to a generic function
are added to its invocables list, acceptors are added to assignables,
and storage tables are added to both lists.  Invoking a generic
function uses the same syntax as a procedure call in Scheme.  The
invocables of the generic function are searched for an appropriate
match, based on the runtime types of the arguments (i.e., the parent
objects) and the lists of specializers of the handlers in the
invocables list.  In order for a handler to be eligible, its
specializers must all be ancestors of the corresponding arguments;
the best match is chosen among the eligible handlers based on how far
up the inheritance chain the specializers are.  If the best match is a 
method, it is executed; if it's a storage table, the value stored in
the table with the arguments as the key is returned.  [TBD: assigning]

[TBD: better explanations, examples!]
