To the Graduate Committee:

I request an extension to my PhD studies.  I arrived at Northeastern
in September 1995, and passed the Qualifying Exams in June 1997.
I submitted my plan of study in October 1998, but since then I have
had to change my plan several times as I discovered that I was not on
the right path to a thesis.  My first thesis proposal draft was
completed in summer 2000, but it wasn't until April 2002 that I
formally submitted a thesis proposal that I was comfortable with and
confident that I could fulfill.  (In the meantime I had papers
published at the Reflection 2001 and AOSD 2002 conferences.)  My
Thesis Committee has approved my thesis proposal, and I am taking the
Comprehensive Exam tomorrow, May 22, 2002.  My plan is to finish the
dissertation by September 2003.  Therefore, I will require a one-year
extension to the usual 7-year university time limit for PhD studies.

Thank you for your consideration.

Doug Orleans
