Scenario for 3-4 players, ~60min<BR><BR>1. Game Materials<BR>- Settlers basic 
set<BR>- 4 Locomotive tokens (Bag 8)<BR>- 1 "Schnellster Lokomitvführer" 
(Fastest Locomotive Driver) Card<BR>- 16 Victory Point Chips (Bag 6)<BR>- 24 
Water Towers (6 in each color, Bag 8)<BR>- 1 Plastic Stand in each player's 
color<BR><BR>Every player receives in one color:<BR>- 15 roads (Rail lines)<BR>- 
4 (4 players) or 6 (3 players) Water Towers<BR>- 5 Settlements<BR>- 4 Cities (2 
at start, 2 set aside)<BR>- 8 Ships (Ferries)<BR>- 1 Locomotive (place in 
plastic stand)<BR><BR>2. Setup<BR>Build the scenario map as in the picture on 
page 32 of the book.<BR>• Every player places his/her locomotive token into the 
plastic stand matching his/her color.<BR>• Each player places two Cities aside; 
they will not be needed until the beginning of the race.<BR>•&nbsp;Each player 
places their Water Towers in front of themselves. They are needed at the 
begining of the Race.<BR>• The 16 victory point chips are laid out. If this 
number is not sufficient, you can find more in the Seafarers 
expansion.<BR><BR>Founding Phase<BR>The Founding phase runs according to the 
regular rules. Only change: No roads are built. The first settlement of each 
player therefore has no road. At the second settlement, a "Railroad Line" (road) 
is built, which is developed in the further process of play into a railway 
system. The first rail distance is already part of the railway system. Details 
follow in the next paragraph. Each player places his Locomotive at his second 
settlement.<BR><BR>3. The Rules Modifications<BR>Building Phase<BR>a) Building 
Rail Lines<BR>A Rail Line costs one Wood (ties) and one Ore (rails), and is 
represented by a road. A railroad line is always built from a vertex to the 
middle of a landscape ( (a) in the figure on page 33).<BR>Each further railroad 
line must always attach to the player's own railway system; building either 
either from a far vertex to link up at the center (b), or building from the 
center in an alternative direction (c).<BR>Junctions can occur at both verticies 
and the center of a landscape. Building of railroad lines along the Landscape 
edges (d) is not allowed.<BR>A rail line can be built in parallel to one or more 
other rail lines (see the illustration on the top of page 34). Parallel building 
costs the usual raw materials, plus an additional cost of one Brick, paid to 
each player who has already build there. If a player cannot pay this additional 
cost, then he or she cannot build the parallel track. For example, in the figure 
on page 34, blue must pay 1 Wood and 1 Ore for the parallel track, and 
additionally must give one Brick to Red and White.<BR><BR>b) Ferries<BR>If a 
railroad line leads to the coast, then it can be continued only with a "Ferry". 
A Ferry can attach directly to a railroad line (different from the usual 
Seafarers expansion rule - neither settlement nor city are required). A Ferry 
may only be built at sea or along the coast (as in the Seafarers expansion). 
Each individual ferry costs 1 Wood and 1 Wool; a Ferry is represented by a 
ship.<BR>Parallel ferries my also be built, like rail lines. The cost is the 
same as for rail lines, i.e., the base cost (one Wood and one Wool) plus one 
Brick to each player who already has a ferry on this line.<BR>(Translator's 
Note: This seems unclear to me when combined with the movement rules, as there 
is nothing there specifically covering vertex-to-vertex movement. I'd play it 
that moving along a ferry costs 1; see later - ckf)<BR><BR>c) Other building 
elements<BR>A settlement costs the same as in the basic game. Additional 
settlements can be created on any available verticies, to which neither a 
railroad line nor a Ferry is connected (neither you own, nor an opponents). The 
two-space rule still applies, however. A City is built as usual. However, a 
settlement can only be upgraded to a City if it is attached to a railway system 
(belonging to any player) already. Each player can only build two Cities. 
Players may not build Roads as in the basic game. Discovery cards are purchased 
as in the basic game; for the "Road Building" event card, a player may build two 
Rail Lines or Ferries. Victory Points from Development Cards must be played 
immediately.<BR><BR>d) Other Victory Points<BR>The Longest Trade Route victory 
point card is not used. A player can receive bonus Victory Chips for connecting 
other player's Settlements to the rail net, for connecting different rail nets, 
and for succesfully contesting the Race. Each player places his or her Victory 
Point chips openly in from of him or herself.<BR>• A player receives one Victory 
Point chip for connecting another player's settlement to the rail net (if it was 
not connected alredy). A player does not receive a chip for the building of a 
rail line to a settlement already attached to the rail net, nor for connecting 
one of his or her own settlements to the net (however, this would deny the other 
players the victory point for connecting that settlement).<BR>• If a player 
connects his rail net with one of an opponent (with which it is not already 
connected), he or she likewise collects one victory point chip (this applies 
also in the Founding phase).<BR><BR>The Running of the Locomotives<BR>The race 
starts for all players as soon as one player has 8 (or more) victory point on 
his or her turn. This player is named the "Starter".<BR><BR>a) Beginning the 
Race<BR>Each player starts the race at his or her second initial settlement 
(where his or locomotive is located). Now the water towers come into play as 
stopovers. Each player - beginning with the starter, then the the others in 
clockwise order - selects a settlement or a city located in his own rail net 
(this may also include a settlement/city belonging to another player) as a 
stopover. Every player must now place one of his/her water towers at the 
selected stopover.<BR><BR>Starting places cannot be selected as stopovers; 
likewise, a place already selected (which alrady has Water Towers) cannot be 
chosen again. If player does not have a suitable place as a stopover, then he 
does not choose a stop for the race.<BR><BR>Additional Rules for 3 Players: Each 
player will select two (instead of one) stopovers for the race. As is the case 
for 4 players, each player selects a location for a Water Tower. Then, there is 
a second selection round; the same conditions apply as in the first round. If a 
player has only one suitable place, then only this place becomes a 
stopover.<BR><BR>Important: With beginning of the race the players may use now 
their 2 remaining cities. That is, they may from now upgrade 2 further 
settlements which are attached to a rail net.<BR><BR>b) Moving with the 
Locomotives<BR>With the start of the Race, there is a new phase - the Movement 
Phase. It follows the buildig phase and ends the turn of that player.<BR>• Only 
a player who has at least 5 Rail Lines/Ferries, may take this phase.<BR>• If a 
player has fewer than 5 Rail Lines/Ferries, his or her locomotive must stay in 
place. He or she may move his/her locomotive as soon as he/she has at least 5 
Rail Lines/Ferries.<BR>• The first player who receives a Movement Phase is the 
"Starter".<BR><BR>The locomotive of the player is moved as follows, depending on 
it's location:<BR>• From a vertex over a railroad line or Ferry to a 
neighbouring landscape tile center; or<BR>• from a landscape center over a 
railroad line or Ferry to a neighbouring vertex.<BR>Every such movement costs 1 
movement point. A player receives as many movement points as the higher of the 
two dice in the production phase (so, if a player rolled a 5 and a 3, he or she 
would receive 5 movement points). A player need not spend all the movement 
points.<BR><BR>Movement over a player's own lines is free. To move over another 
player's lines costs one resource (moving player's choice) per Rail Line/Ferry. 
For parallel track, only one player (moving player's choice) need be paid. If a 
player cannot pay the resource, then he or she may not move over the 
line.<BR><BR>When a Locomotive arrives at a stopover point, at which one of the 
player's Water Towers is located, it must immediately stop (and lose the rest of 
it's movement points). The moving player takes a Water Tower in his/her color 
and places it in front of him/herself. Each Water Tower so collected is worth 
one victory point.<BR><BR>When one player has collected all of his/her Water 
Towers, the Race (and with it, the game) ends. This player receives the 
"Schnellster Lokomitvfürher" (Fastest Locomotive Driver) card, which is worth 
one victory point. Note: Since the winner of the race collected at least 1 water 
tank more than the other players, the winner of the "Schnellster Lokomitvfürher" 
brings in at least a 2 victory point advantage.<BR><BR>During the race, further 
settlements, cities, railroad lines and Ferries may be built, and development 
cards may be purchased. Also, further bonus victory points may be earned for 
connections.<BR><BR>Special case: At the start of the race, it could be that the 
rail net of a player is not yet connected with the other networks. In this case 
the race cannot be won until the connection to the other networks is made during 
the running.<BR><BR>4. Game End<BR>The game ends when one player complete the 
race. The winner is then the player with the most victory points. In case of a 
tie for most victory points, determine the winner by the following conditions, 
in order:<BR>• The winner of the Race;<BR>• The starter of the Race;<BR>• The 
closest to the starter of the Race (in clockwise order)<BR><BR>Catan Express 
beyond the Island<BR><BR>If you'd like to use the Catan Express rules with 
different maps, feel free (although remember that Ore will be very important). 
Use the following additional rules:<BR>• Every player receives 15 ships 
(Ferries).<BR>• Ferries are no longer placed along the coast; they are placed in 
the same way as Rail Lines - from a landscape vertex to the middle of a Sea 
tile.<BR><BR>Catan-Express<BR>for 5-6 players (~120 min)<BR><BR>This scenario is 
played the same as the 3-4 player version, with the following change:<BR>• Use 
the map layout on page 37.<BR>• Each player receives 5 or 6 (per the number of 
players) Water Towers. There is only one round of selecting stopovers, as in the 
4-player game.<BR>Don't forget: In all 5- and 6- player scenarios, there is a 
"bonus" building phase.<BR>
