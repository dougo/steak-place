<h3>Abstract</h3>

    <blockquote>Languages that support incremental programming, that
    is, the construction of new program components by specifying how
    they differ from existing components, allow for clean separation
    of concerns. Object-oriented languages support incremental
    programming with inheritance and dynamic dispatch features:
    whenever a message is sent, a decision occurs, but the branches of
    the decision can be specified in separate components.
    Aspect-oriented programming and predicate dispatching both
    introduce language mechanisms that improve on this support by
    allowing an extensible decision to depend on information about the
    message send other than just the dynamic type of the receiver or
    arguments.  A small prototype language is presented that unifies
    the best features of these mechanisms, providing uniform support
    for incremental programming whether concerns are crosscutting or
    not.  The language is demonstrated with a running example, a small
    data structure library that is incrementally extended with
    optimizations and new operations.
