                    to standard interfaces together with scripts that bind
                    these objects together to perform certain tasks.
                    Scripting encourages a component-oriented approach to
                    application development in which frameworks of reusable
                    components (objects and scripts) are carefully
                    engineered in an evolutionary software life-cycle, with
                    the ultimate goal of supporting application
                    construction largely from these interchangeable,
                    prefabricated components. The activity of constructing
                    the running application is supported by a visual
                    scripting tool that replaces the textual paradigm of
                    programming with a visual paradigm of direct
                    manipulation and editing of both application and user
                    interface components. We present scripting by means of
                    some simple examples, and we describe a prototype of a
                    visual scripting tool, called Vista. We conclude with
                    some observations on the environmental support needed
                    to support a component-oriented software life-cycle,
                    using as a specific example the application de

                    manipulation language based on pattern matching, called
                    {\it PaMaL}, are introduced. The operations of
                    PaMaL(addition and deletion of nodes and edges) use
                    patterns to indicate the parts of the instance that are
                    affected by the operation. We give the syntax and
                    semantics of the operations and the programming
                    constructs(loop, procedure and program) of PaMaL. We
                    add a reduce-operation to work with a special group of
                    instance, the {\it reduced instances}.}",
