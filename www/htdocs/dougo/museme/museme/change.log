NAMESERVER.SCM
+ Modified NEW-ENV so that creates a person named ME.

OBJECT.SCM ;; New file implemented encapsulated Scheme objects.
           ;; This was before I realized that TRANSLATE does the same thing!

PACKAGES.SCM
 + Export WHO from SERVER
 + Import WHO into MUSEME-SCHEME

SERVER.SCM
 + Added WHO, which is described in documentation, but not implemented.
 + Added *USER-TICKS* to abstract over amount of time user has.
 + Added USER-SESSION to abstract over a session.
 + Added MUSEME-HERALD, *SERVER-VERSION*, *SERVER-DATE* to abstract 
   over herald.
 + Added USER-EVAL to abstract over evaluation of user expressions.
 + Added HANDLE-ENGINE to abstract over handling engine resumptions.
 + Added USER-INITIALIZE, which by default connects the user to
   his/her default player.

TRANSLATE.SCM
 + Updated MUD-OBJECT to take a key.

USER-ENV.SCM
 + Fixed SEND to unquote variable UN
 + Change UNSHARE to be analagous to FORGET (i.e., now returns #t or #f).

TRANSLATE.SCM
+ VALUE message now returns thunk, so that procedures can 
  be returned as values rather than be applied.

11/22/94 (lyn)

TRANSLATE.SCM
+ Massive overhaul of this file. Interface is now (scheme->mud key scheme-obj)
  and (mud->scheme mud-widget).

WIDGET.SCM
+ Fixed a bug in SET-NAME!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11/23/94 

MUSEME-COMMANDS.SCM 
+ (lyn) Updated TAKE and DROP to deal handle scheme objects in a reasonable
  way. Convenient, but not sure this is the right thing.
  (because it is outside of the usual mud model).
+ (bjr) Fixed but in DROP: if dropping a scheme object, must convert to
  mud widget first, take it, and then drop.  But don't take objects
  that are not automatically generated or get messages about self
  is trying to take object from self.

* (bjr) Developed a single-user mode, implemented by the files SINGLE-USER.SCM
  and SU-PACKAGES.SCM. Modified MAKEFILE to include a single-user entry.

* (bjr) Implemented an eval server in CPU.MUD
