This directory contains the January 1995 version of the MUSEME system,
updated in August 1997 by Doug Orleans to run in the latest version of
Scheme-48 (0.46).

MUSEME is a multi-user Scheme system in which users can share Scheme
objects; it can be used as the basis for a simple MUD.  MUSEME was
designed by Franklyn Turbak and Dan Winship at MIT and was implemented
by Dan Winship during the summer of 1994.

MUSEME was implemented in Scheme-48. What little documentation
there is can be found in the doc directory.
