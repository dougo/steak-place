<H1><HR>Mix Tapes</H1>

Every once in a while I'm inspired to make a tape of a bunch of songs
I like, usually to give to friends to try and get them to listen to
``cool'' music.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  Usually I
end up making the tape more for myself than for anyone else, which is
probably how it's supposed to be anyway.  I've saved some of the more
interesting ones:

<DL>
<DT> <A HREF="NorCal94.html">NorCal '94</A>
<DD> A bunch of songs from Northern California bands of the early 1990s.
<DT> <A HREF="NorCal95.html">NorCal '95</A>
<DD> The sequel!
<DT> <A HREF="Loud93.html">Loud Stuff</A>
<DD> Just a random collection of loud songs.
<DT> <A HREF="MyDreamingHill.html">My Dreaming Hill</A>
<DD> Some shoegazer/hypnodrone stuff.
<dt> <a href="Danielle.html">Dynamic Alternative, New-wave, Indie,
     Etc. Listening &amp; Learning Experience</a>
<dd> A tape of songs for my sister, who was 13 years old and learning
     the bass guitar at the time.
<dt> <a href="Mark.html">Monsters, Animals, Robots, &amp; Kings</a>
<dd> A tape of songs for my brother, who was 10 years old at the time.
