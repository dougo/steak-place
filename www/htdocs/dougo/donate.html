    <HR><H1>Donations via PayPal</H1>
    
    <p>Lately there's been a lot of discussion about intellectual
      property, copyrights, digital distribution, and the online
      economy.  I have a lot of opinions about these issues;
      someday I'll make a web page to present them in more detail, but 
      the main thing I believe in is this: <strong>People are willing
      to compensate the creators of things they value, as long as it's 
      easy to do so.</strong>  I then realized that I, myself, have
      created things of value, on this very web site--
      <a href="poll/">music polls</a>,
      <a href="mud/com3411.html">academic papers</a>,
      <a href="scanned/photos/110/">photos</a>, even my
      <a href="links.html">page of links</a>--
      that people might be willing to compensate me for in
      appreciation of my efforts.  So, I figured, why not make it easy 
      for them to do so?</p>

    <p>The problem was, I can't afford to accept credit cards, and
      sending a check or money through snail mail is a hassle for both
      parties.  What I really want is an online currency-- an old
      idea, but one that still hasn't really been implemented well.
      Meanwhile, along comes 
      <a href="https://secure.paypal.com/affil/pal=dougo%40ccs.neu.edu" target="_blank">PayPal</A>,
      which lets people pay each other with credit cards (or direct
      deposit and withdrawal from bank accounts) for free.  Follow
      that link to sign up-- you and I each get $5 free!</p>

    <p>Anyway, once you've signed up, you can pay me whatever you feel 
      like this web site is worth to you-- a dollar? a nickel? a
      penny?  Whatever works.  (You can't make micro-transactions yet,
      so no halfpenny donations.)  Unfortunately, their one-click
      payment system requires a "Premier" account, which charges a
      <a href="http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/fees-outside">30-cent fee</a>
      on every transaction-- screw that!  So you'll have to type in my
      email address
      (<A HREF="mailto:dougo@ccs.neu.edu">&lt;dougo@ccs.neu.edu&gt;</A>)
      by hand in their "Email Money" form.  So much for my "make it
      easy" plan, I know, but at least it's easier than stuffing an
      envelope!</p>

    <p>So, let me know which parts of the site are valuable to you,
      and put your money where your mouth is!  On the other hand, if
      it's been a big waste of time for you, let me know your address
      and I'll compensate you for your time-- just realize that I
      value your time quite a bit less than my own...</p>

    <p>I'll keep this page updated with a current tally so you can see 
      how well the experiment is working.  Drop me a line if you're
      performing a similar experiment yourself, especially if you have 
      suggestions for a better method of payment.</p>

    <p><strong>TOTAL DONATIONS: $3.36</strong></p>

    <p><strong>TOTAL REFERRAL BONUSES: $10.00</strong></p>
