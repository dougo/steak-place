Hey Doug:

Mitigating circumstances have significantly curtailed my music buying
over the past 18 months.  I don't think I've bought 20 records this
year.  Subsequently, I've primarily been sticking with new releases from
bands I already know of and like.

Thanx for putting these polls together.  I know it takes a fair bit of
effort.  I find them useful.

MMc

Here's the records I've been listening to lately...

Elliott Smith, "Either/Or" - Kill Rock Stars
Edith Frost, "Calling Over Time" - Drag City
Eleventh Dream Day, "Eighth" - Thrill Jockey
Bad Livers, "Hogs on the Highway" - Sugarhill
Calexico, "Spoke" - Quarterstick
Laika, "Sounds of the Sattelites" - Too Pure
The Sonora Pine, "II" - Quarterstick
The Sea and Cake, "The Fawn" - Thrill Jockey
Cheer Accident, "Enduring the American Dream" - Pravda Recs
Jeb Loy Nichols, "Lover's Knot" - Capitol/EMI [Very non-Chug, doh]
U.S. Maple, "Sang Phat Editor" - Skin Graft
Skeleton Key, "Fantastic Spikes Through Balloon" - Capitol
*Tricky, "Pre-Millenium Tension" - Island
*Dr. Octagon, "Dr. Octagonecologyst" - Bulk Recordings
*Rachel's, "The Sea and the Bells" - Quarterstick

* I think these are late '96 releases.  Not sure if they came out late
enough to make your window.
