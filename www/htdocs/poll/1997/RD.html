hello doug-

i really have been unable to buy any records this year, but i was given a
copy of the (for lack of any better way to describe it) compilation
entitled _Buena Vista Social Club_ (Nonesuch?) and i think it is deep &amp;
wide.  not very chug (maybe loosely definable as "chnanga"?) but it's what
i got and i like it better than anything i didn't get.

regards,
robert
