Hi there, 
Been listening to more old than new this year, but....

1. Teenage Fanclub: "Songs From Northern Britain" on Creation/Columbia.
Underrated and utterly beautiful album. 
2. Pernice Brothers: "Monkey Suit" 7-inch on Sub-Pop. Scud Mt. Boys
singer/gtrist, now main project as Scuds are no longer.    
3. X: "Beyond and Back" on Elektra
4. Mark Eitzel: "West" on Warner Bros. Don't like as much as any of the
other    stuff, still a few gems here.
5. Son Volt: "Straightaways" on Warner Bros.
6. Don Caballero: "Trey Dog's Acid" 7-inch on Touch &amp; Go
7. The Jayhawks: "Sound of Lies" on American Recordings. Same as Eitzel
comment    above.
8. Storm and Stress: "self-titled" on Touch &amp; Go
9. Solar Coaster: "Zero-Sum" 7-inch on Turnbuckle Records. A-side reminds me
of    Metal Circus and is refreshing in that sense, seriously. 

Bye,
Dave Reid
