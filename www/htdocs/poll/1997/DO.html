*Came out on Kranky in 1996, was re-recorded and re-released by
Beggars in 1997; the band considers it a 1997 release.  It was in my
year-end list last year too, but hey, I liked it that much.

Any of these might have made the top 20 on another day:

    Various Artists _Badaboom Gramaphone 2_ (Badabing)

    just doesn't work without all 4...
