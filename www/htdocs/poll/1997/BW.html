There are 4 records that I listened to quite a bit, that didn't come out in 97 
(I don't think). they are:

swirlies        they spent their wild youthful.....     taang
sheryl crow     s/t
chavez          2nd album
smashing pumpkins mellen collie...


No doubt, I'll see the compiled  list and say, "Oh yeah, I forgot about that 
one."
