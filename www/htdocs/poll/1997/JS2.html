Well, I'm not even close to closing the books on the year (there are 
'97 records by Brutal Truth, Michael Gordon, Fred Frith, and the Judas 
Iscariot that I bet are at least as good as the MF Doom single, but I 
haven't heard 'em yet).  Still, these are 19 pretty good records, in 
approximate declining order of pretty-goodness. 
 
(doug: I'm not sure what's "hard to find", exactly, but I've tried to 
include URLs for labels/mail-order-sources for some non-US-major-label 
releases.  Feel free to mark 'em up or delete 'em.)
