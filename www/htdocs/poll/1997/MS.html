Only ten. That means I left out Mogwai, The Sea and Cake, Yo La Tengo and
umpteen others. Most of these were rambled about on Review Addict at
&lt;http://dsl.org/m/doc/rev/&gt;.
 
Bardo Pond, _Lapsed_. Bean dip psych rock at its finest hour.
(Matador) 

Broadcast, _Work and Non Work_. Revives the best part of the 70s.
(Drag City)

Flying Saucer Attack, _New Lands_. FSA show how much a DIY one-man band can
do.
(Drag City)

Alan Licht, _The Evan Dando of Noise?_ Got it mainly for the liner notes,
but the music ain't bad, either -- see
&lt;http://dsl.org/cgi-bin/display.pl/m/doc/rev/97/11/evan-dando&gt;.
(Corpus Hermeticum, POB 124, Lyttelton, Canterbury, NZ)

Beth Orton, _Trailer Park_. One of those mythical records that I fall in
love with after reading a review and/or looking at the cover art &amp; imagining
what it should be like; as it turns out, the best songs on the record are
her two covers. So fuck style; substance is eternal.
(Dedicated/Heavenly)

Piano Magic, _Wintersport_. I heard this band on the radio twice in two
weeks, both times while out late-night driving, and was convinced to buy
their entire catalog.
(i Records, 131A George Lane, South Woodford  London, E18 1AN UK)

Run On, _No Way_. Run On. One of my favorite bands of today. I'm still
peeved about missing their Speak in Tongues show because I didn't hear about
it until it was too late (update your Web site, guys!).
(Matador) 

Sonic Youth, _SYR1_ and _SYR2_. They're the penultimate musician's musicians,
and maybe my favorite band in the whole wide world, if I had to choose.
(SYR, POB 6179, Hoboken NJ 07030) 

V/A, _Kerouac -- kicks joy darkness_ The first major label recording that I
am actually on. Okay, it's just an audience cheer at the end of the Ginsberg
track, but...
(Ryko)

Wheat, _Wheat_. Yes, I kinda liked this. About 10 of these kind of
college-rock records come out every year that I end up liking a whole lot
with no reason why except for the record's ambience. First noticed this
phenomenon a couple years back with that Remy Zero record on Geffen.
(Sugar Free Records, POB 14166, Chicago, IL 60614)
