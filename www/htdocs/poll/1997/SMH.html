Subject: chug poll vote

Hey Doug,
Just firstly I should say how much I (and everyone else hopefully)
appreciates your getting this together. I myself do a Gig of the Month poll
on a UK list which attracts maybe 30 people voting for their top 5 gigs,
and that's always a hassle, so I can really see something as gargantuan as
the chug poll must take a lot of effort.
On this year's releases I found it hard to vote for 10 singles but 10
albums was no problem (the usual format for other polls I guess). By the
way, you asked about formats etc - well, just a couple of observations from
other polls - when the NME do their yearly poll they have their top 100 or
whatever and then a separate category for re-releases which is just a top
5. I know you avoid re-releases but if you find people are clamouring for
them then that might be a workaround.
Second, the uk-indie poll guy only counts votes which have attracted more
than one voter i.e. if you give your fave lp 10 points then it won't count
unless someone else casts even one point it will show . Interesting
philosophy I supose (your one-offs do get credit with an honourable mention
at the bottom).

 I feel that voting for singles in a mixed poll can sometimes be pointless
unless it's a real well-known one (Tubthumping, anyone?) but your promise
to list stuff beyond the 20 allows me to salve my conscience. (I say lp and
cd but I this doesn't necessarily mean that these formats are universally
available - or at all, it's just a differentiation between albums and
single releases. I suppose albums are higher up the pecking order as
there's more value from a dozen tracks than one, but each to their own, eh?
Anyway, without further ado...

Half Man Half Biscuit - Voyage to the Bottom of the Road (Probe Plus)
Long Fin Killie - Amelia (Too Pure/American Recordings)
Kenickie - At The Club (EMI?)
Edwyn Collins - I'm Not Following You (Setanta)

Pizzicato 5 - god, can't remember the title! Someone else must have voted

Adventures in Stereo - s/t (Creeping Bent)
Mogwai - Young Team (Chemikal Underground)
