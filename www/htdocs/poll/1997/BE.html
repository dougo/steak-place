in alphabetical order and not otherwise ranked...btw, thanks again for
continuing to do this!!

764-Hero	We're Solids CD			Up
another seven gtr+drums tracks guaranteed to rip at your heart-strings.

Ein Heit		The Lightning and The Sun CD		Temporary Freedom
silkworm reunites with joel phelps and adds an excellent songwriter to
make a moody rock record - now how much would you pay?  there are a
couple of iffy numbers on here but overall it's pretty strong, and "no
revolution" is stellar.

Hovercraft	Akathisia CD				Mute
i usually don't go for space rock type stuff, but this really floats my
boat.  this album sounds like loop in a couple of spots, but hovercraft
somehow manage to keep each of their ten-minutes-and-up pieces
interesting.

Hurl		Not A Memory CD			My Pal God/Peas Kor
i may like don caballero better as far as pittsburgh bands go, but hurl
takes the cake when it comes to variety and texture.  apparently another
swan song album, which no doubt saddens the hearts of fans of the rock
everywhere.

Lync		Remembering the Fireballs LP		K
posthumous singles and b-sides collection from a fabulous emo band.  buy
the CD, though, it's got more tracks.  grrrrrr....

Sicko		You Are Not the Boss of Me CD		Empty
seattle's finest pop-punks keep up their good work with another album
full of yummy morsels, including an iron maiden cover.

Spaceheads	Round the Outside CD			Dark Beloved Cloud
for anyone who wasn't fortunate enough to catch spaceheads on their u.s.
tour in 1996, this live album recreates the experience well.  heavily
processed trumpet overtop of great drumming, very tasty.

Stereolab	Dots And Loops CD			Elektra
it took a while to get into this and does continue the disturbing
easy-listening trend in places, but overall it's a refreshing new
direction for the lab.

Team Dresch	Deattached/Venus Lacy 7"		Candy Ass
apparently, this is the last release we'll get from team dresch, sadly.
t.d. and sleater-kinney made two of my favorite records last year,
highly intelligent music made by women that totally rocks as well.

Various		The 10 Things Northwest Punk		Alien Popstars
		Compilation CD
more flavors than baskin-robbins and tastier to boot, this companion to
_10 things_ (one of the finest punk rock fanzines out there) showcases
the broad range of punk bands alive and well here in the pacific
northwest.

Various		What's Up Matador CD			Matador
well, the second cd at least - the track selection on the first wasn't
as good, in my opinion.  there are some real gems on the unreleased
tracks cd, though.  anyone with even a passing interest in so-called
"indie rock" should pick this up - it's super cheap as well.
