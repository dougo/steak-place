Subject: chug poll 1997

1. Polvo "Shapes" (Touch &amp; Go)
2. Apples in Stereo "Tone Soul Evolution" (Spinart)
3. Company of Big Beats (self-titled) (Rhythm/Noise)
4. Labradford "Mi Media Naranja" (Kranky)

That's it.  I skipped last year's poll because I didn't
think I'd heard enough records from 1996.  That ended up
being true as my favorite record from that year is Neutral
Milk Hotel's "On Avery Island," which I didn't hear until
April of 1997.  I heard very few 1997 records, and some
(like the LPs from Pavement and the Grifters) were decent,
but not worthy of making a "best" list.  I'd elaborate more,
but I'm getting this in right at the deadline.
