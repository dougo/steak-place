honorable mention
David Grubbs (Table of the Elements), Edith Frost (Drag City), Cold Cold
Hearts (KRS), Darling Little Jackhammer (hey buddy!), John Fahey (totE)

the only other record I bought this year (reissues and box sets aside)
that fits the '97 category was Pavement.  I've listened to it once.
