Alison Faith Levy
Top 20 for 1997 ( A year of good music but way too many major label releases
on my list)

Elliott Smith - Either/Or (Kill Rock Stars)
Radiohead - OK Computer (some big major label)
Spiritualized - Ladies &amp; Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space (Arista)
Richard Buckner - Devotion &amp; Doubt (MCA)
Pavement - Brighten the Corners (Matador)
Built to Spill - Perfect from Now On (WB)
Belle &amp; Sebastian - If You're Feeling Sinister (don't know)
The Sea &amp; Cake - The Fawn (Thrill Jockey)
Brian Jonestown Massacre - Give It Back (Bomp)
Yo La Tengo - I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One (Matador)
Stereolab - Dots and Loops (Elektra)
Labradford - Mi Media Naranja (Kranky)
The Mommyheads - s/t (Geffen)
Teenage Fanclub - Songs from Northern Britain (Creation/Columbia)
Ben Folds Five - Whatever &amp; Ever, Amen (Sony)
Smithsonian Folkways Anthology of American Folk Music
Dusty Springfield Anthology
Oblivians - Oblivians Play 9 Songs with Mr. Quintron (Crypt)
Ween - The Mollusk (Elektra)
The Flaming Lips - Zaireeka (WB) for sheer chutzpah!

My favorite records that didn't come out last year but that I discovered and
listened to a lot: Scud Mountain Boys - Massachusetts, the 1st and 2nd
Elliott Smith albums, Lisa Germano's Geek the Girl and Exerpts from a Love
Circus

The worst thing about last year was losing Jeff Buckley, who kicked my ass
and touched my soul more than anyone in the last 10 years and I will miss him
dearly.
