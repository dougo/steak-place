However to just list them makes no sense, so these are a few that truely left a lasting impression and merit the attention of anybody interested in discussing interesting music issued in 2002.</p><ol><li><a name="out_hud__street_dad" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#out_hud__street_dad"><strong>OUT HUD</strong>, <cite>STREET DAD</cite></a><br />Finally, a instrumental beauty for the year 2002.</li><li><a name="keith_fullerton_whitman__playthroughs" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#keith_fullerton_whitman__playthroughs"><strong>Keith Fullerton Whitman</strong>, <cite>Playthroughs</cite> (Kranky)</a><br />I'm not so sure this really deserves to be here, but I've not heard any drone this powerfully mood altering since Magnog.</li><li><a name="bright_eyes__lifted_or_the_story_is_in_the_soil_keep_your_ear_to_the_ground" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#bright_eyes__lifted_or_the_story_is_in_the_soil_keep_your_ear_to_the_ground"><strong>Bright Eyes</strong>, <cite>LIFTED</cite></a><br />Maybe not the new Dylan, but you should decide for yourself.  This is my first listren to Bright Eyes, I've also heard The Good Life, but this is much better.</li><li><a name="flaming_lips__day_they_shot_a_hole_in_the_jesus_egg" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#flaming_lips__day_they_shot_a_hole_in_the_jesus_egg"><strong>Flaming Lips</strong>, <cite>he Day they Shot a Hole in the Jesus Egg</cite></a><br />My favorite reissue of the year.  I don't know what has happened to indie-rock, but maybe the Lips and the Rev did not have enough influence, maybe this reissue will help.  In a Priest Driven Ambulence would be the album, the other disc is a tosser.</li><li><a name="sonic_youth__murray_street" /><a href="byartistwithcomments.html#sonic_youth__murray_street"><strong>Sonic Youth</strong>, <cite>Murray Street</cite></a><br />This was moving.  It's impressive how well tuned my brain must be to these textures, their ability to control and harness distortion within the context of anthemic pop songs is still something to behold.</li><li><br />no more.</li></ol><p /><hr /><a href="44.html">prev</a> | <a href="voters.html">list</a> | <a href="33.html">next</a></body></html>
