chance to list eazy-e as a late great 'short player'.  but i wouldn't sink
that low for a laugh.  really though, all jests aside.  the soundtrack for
'murder was the case' was decent.  and really, the new dogg pound cd is 
alright too.  'daz' and 'courupt' (sp) especially.  the whole w-balls thing
just gets me every time.
     thanks again.  i gosta go now.  a couple of my girls got killed in a car
wreck last night and i got some business to take care of.

Doug--in under the wire, here's a top ten, in alphabetical order:

The Apartments -Life Full of Farewells- (Hot/Restless)
The Bruces -Hialeah Pink- (Sing, Eunuchs!)
Edwyn Collins -Gorgeous George- (Setanta/Bar-None)
Tony Conrad -Slapping Pythagoras- (Table of the Elements)
Diskothi-Q -The Wandering Jew- (Shrimper)
Arnold Dreyblatt -Animal Magnetism- (Tzadik)
Thomas Jefferson Slave Apts. -Bait and Switch- (Onion/American)
Overpass -Manhattan (Beach)- (Smells Like)
Refrigerator -How You Continue Dreaming- (Communion)
Wckr Spgt -A Tea Party of Love- (Car in Car Disco Product)

    I've been enthusiastic about very few 7"s this year, so I'll skip 
the non-full-length list.  Feel free to print the list, but ONLY if 
you attach the following comments: 1) Although several are by people 
with whom I have played, but I am not directly involved in any of the
above recordings.  2) The Joel Phelps and Simon Joyner records came 
out so late in the year that I honestly couldn't decide whether to 
'replace' something I had already placed in my top 10.  3) The Blue 
Aeroplanes' -Rough Music- (Beggar's Banquet) is a close 11th, a 
return to form, and probably sold less than most of the above indie 
releases.

I bought a bunch of records last year but most were either catching up on 
back-catalogs or, um, not all that inspiring.  So I don't actually have 10 
1995 releases that I'd recommend.  These are the ones I really liked last year. 
 
1. Yo La Tengo - Electro-Pura (Matador) 
2. Hum - You'd Prefer an Astronaut (RCA) 
3. Son Volt - Trace (Warner) 
4. Joel Phelps - Warm Springs Night (El Recordo) 
5. Foo Fighters (Capitol) 
6. Helium - Dirt of Luck (Matador) 
 
we just got the Stereolab record... possibly if I had a chance to hear that 
more it might make the list. 
 
Take care! 
Christie

Every year I've been following independent music (basically a decade now),
there's always been a coterie of my pals who insist that it ain't like it
used to be, that it was so much better in the heyday of &lt;insert any band or
label or city's musical flowering&gt;.

Every other year, I've been able to pull about 4 or 5 examples out of the air
and say, no, you're just not paying attention, but '95 truly strikes me as an
off year, probably the first year since I've been following music in any form
(we're talking about since I was ten, here), that I can't come up w/10 albums
of the year I really loved. 

Or, I dunno, maybe I've become as jaded and cynical as my pals seemed to be.
I do know that for the first time in my life I got pretty sick of music and
the fucking circus that surrounds it (a feeling which, fortunately, has
proven to be temporary). I know that the rock ain't dead, not by a longshot,
and I'm not pining for '85, or '81, or '88. But things do seem a bit thin
these days, and my patience for the passable and
technically-good-but-unexciting is virtually nonexistent. The latter is
probably a good thing; the former kinda worries me.

It took me such a great effort to even THINK about this year that
I'm not editing my list.  Pick ten @ random or something (well, eliminate
the ones that aren't from this year first; I'm sure some of these are '94
crop, but I've no idea)....

"Gamera"/"Cliff Dweller Society" 12"    Tortoise


Give precedence to ones that other people may have also picked, which
thusly have slightly more than a snowball's chance in hell of making it on
the big chug list in the sky.  I hate doing this because I know I've
forgotten my three actual favorites, but I guess that's life.  Sorry for
the 300% return.

I didn't actually buy a whole lot of stuff that came out in '95 (I
was too busy working my way through the Stereolab back catalog), I'm
afraid, so this is sort of my very small  "things I bought that I
still like" list, rather than some exhaustive whittling-down of 300
recordings that I sytematically weighed and analyzed. That also
explains the rather sizable Tampa Bay bias. I hope that's OK.

Here we go. The format is ARTIST, TITLE, LABLE:

FULL-LENGTH ALBUMS
Home, IX, Relativity
Yo La Tengo, Electr-O-Pura, Matador
Stereolab, Refried Ectoplasm, Drag City
Pagan Saints, Promise, Ironweed Music
Superchunk, Incidental Music, Merge

LESS-THAN-FULL-LENGTH STUFF
Pee Shy, Yellow Race Car 7-inch, Screw Music Forever

After incredibly painful agonizing over that eleventh record (I may have to
testify about these), here are my top ten full lenghts of 1995:
Chris Knox - _Songs of You and Me_ (Caroline/Flying Nun)
Spent - _Songs of Drinking and Rebellion_ (Merge)
Franklin Bruno - _A Bedroom Community_ (Simple Machines)
Palace Music - _Viva Last Blues_ (Drag City/Palace Records)
Sleater-Kinney - _Sleater-Kinney_ (Chainsaw)
Long Fin Killie - _Houdini_ (Too Pure/American)
Charalambides - _Market Square_ (Siltbreeze)
Magnetic Fields - _Get Lost_ (Merge)
Dump - _I Can Hear Music_ (Brinkman)
Tindersticks - _The Second Tindersticks Album_ (This Way Up/London)

In case you were wondering (this probably being your fortieth list or so),
Geraldine Fibbers - _Lost Somewhere Between Earth and My Home_ (Capitol)
was the eleventh record.

Here are my top ten non-full lengths for 1995:
Built to Spill/Caustic Resin - _Built to Spill/Caustic Resin_ EP (Up)
Incredible Force of Junior - _Stronger_ 7" (Cher Doll)
Pee - _Egghead Billy_ 7" (March)
Helium - _Superball_ EP (Matador)
LungLeg - _Shagg the Tiger_ EP (Piao)
Roy Montgomery - _Something Else Again_ 7" (Roof Bolt)
Thinking Fellers Union Local 282 - _Everyday_ 7" (Amarillo)
Retsin - _Salt Lick_ EP (Simple Machines)
Grifters - _Eureka_ EP (Shangri-La)
For Carnation - _Fight Songs_ EP (Matador)

Both lists are not in order and you can attach my name to them.  I am not
ashamed.

I've  been  totally swamped with with work and haven't had a lot of time to
think about my top 10 but off the top of my head these are some full length
releases that I enjoyed:

	Ditch Croaker - Chimpfactor EP
	Love Battery - Straight Freak Ticket
	Spent -(can't remember the title, the one with the blue sky on the
 		cover)
	Unun - Super Shiny Dreams
	Magic Hour - Will They Turn You On....
	Teengenerate - Get Action and Smash Hits
	Ashley Von Hurter and the Haters EP
	Apples in Stereo - Fun Trick Noisemaker
	Cheater Slicks full length release
	Good Horsey - Kazue

Some singles I liked
	The Lune side of the Lune/Karate split single
	All those Fuxa sides of the numerous split singles
	Urusei Yatsura 7"
	The Verlaines/Carter song "Some Fantasy" off of Red Hot Bothered
Well, I didn't buy too many singles this year

Top 5 rocking Boston bands
	Magic Hour
	Cheater Slicks
	Dambuilders
	Prime Movers
	The Lune
and  if  we  can  count  Providence,  Ashley Von Hurter and the Haters/Thee
Hydrogen Terrors.

I'll  probably  think of others later but it will be past the deadline. I'm
proud of this list, I think that Gerard Cosloy loathes every band on it.

wants. So punk that it just ain't punk any more. Tequillarific.

Meteorologist of the Year:The Weather Channel's Mark Mancusso
  Finesse, grace, a winning smile, all things that make the weather worth
watching. This is the only thing that makes me regret my current lack of
cable.

All right, here are my top 6 '95 releasesin no particular order. (I 
didn't want to round it up to ten with albums I liked less).  The Bowie was 
released in England in '93 but I don't think it was released here until 
this year.  You can decide if thAT counts as a '95 release.  These are 
all long players (at least):

David Bowie:  Buddha of Suburbia  (not that horrendous Outside thing)

PJ Harvey: To Bring You My Love

Prince: The Gold Experience

Velvet Underground: Peel Slowly and See (new compilation- 5 cds)

Steeleye Span: Spanning the Years (new compilation- 2 cds)

I almost didn't submit to your list collection because I don't feel that I've
done enough new listening this past year to submit a list even definitive to 
my own tastes. Nevertheless, here are the 10 '95 releases I enjoyed the most.
(No order)

Bobb Trimble                 _Jupiter Transmission_          (Parallel World)

Glands of External Secretion &lt;various titles&gt;                (Starlight
Furn.) Flying Saucer Attack         _Further_                       (Drag City)

Roy Montgomery               _Scenes From The South Island_  (Drunken Fish)

Albums

GBV _Alien Lanes_
The Who _Live at Leeds_ (should qualify)
Bardo Pond _Bufo Alvarius . . etc._ (if it came out this year)
Dead C _White House_
Flying Saucer Attack _Chorus_
Tortoise remixes
David S. Ware _Cryptology_
Charalambides _Market Square_
Pram _Sargasso Sea_
Palace Music _Viva Last Blues_

I didn't buy a lot of singles this year, so I don't feel qualified to speak
on it.

Here's my Chugchanga Island Disks for '95 in no particular order. A rather
myopic collection, but they made me happy.

The first 7 or so came easy.  The last few were harder to choose.  As I
started this message I was still wavering on the 10th one.  The ones that
I most want to include but cannot are Bailter Space, Laika, and 6FS.

When I compiled the list it dawned on me that I should pack my bags and 
head to Chicago.  Guess I'm afraid of climates where, if left outside 
during the winter or left air conditionerless during the summer, one is 
subject to death.

Ironically, only two of those on the list graced our town; those based
geographically closest (Pavement) and most distant (Dirty 3).  [I think
Australia is further away than Sicily...?]

Good Luck -- MMc

Freakwater "Old Paint" - Thrill Jockey Thrill022

I wasn't even going to do this, but since you're putting out the effort...I
had a tough time buying good records this year, and to tell you the truth, I
let my friends by most of the new stuff.  It was really tough coming up with
ten I bought and actually liked, and frankly, I'm not 100% nutty over most
of these.

(in no order, except for the first three)

Bowery Electric- Bowery Electric (Kranky) - 100% nutty about
LaBradford - A Stable Reference (Kranky) - 100% nuttly about
U.S. Maple - Long Hair In Three Stages (Skin Graft) - 100% nuty about
Bailter Space - Wammo (Matador)
Yo La Tengo - Electr - O - Pura (Matador)
John Coltrane - The Heavyweight Champion Box (Atlantic)
Lanterna - Lanterna (Parasol)
Unwound - The Future of What (Kill Rock Stars)
Gastr del sol - The Harp Factory on Lake Street (Table of the Elements)
Pell Mell - Interstate (DGC)

This would have been way easier if I had bought more jazz reissues this
year. Mainly, most of the records I buy in a given year were released in the
previous couple of years. What a bummer to not get free records. I'll have
to start a zine up again.

Woo, it hasn't been much of a year.  Most of the stuff I've been really
excited about didn't come out this year.  Most of the rest was reissues
(Elvis Costello, man....).

Also didn't buy a lot of 7"s.  The ones I did buy I haven't listened to
more than once, for the most part.

Anyway, here goes:

ALBUMS
  Yo La Tengo *Electr-o-pura*
  S.F. Seals *Truth Walks in Sleepy Shadows*
  Flying Saucer Attack *Chorus*
  Team Dresch *Personal Best*
  18th Dye *Tribute to a Bus*
  Sone &lt;self titled&gt;
  Bugskull *Phantasies and Senseition*
  Pell Mell *Interstate*
  Space Needle *Voyager*
  Swoon 23 *Famous Swan Song*

SINGLES
  Sone "747 (apogee, perigee, and dramomine)" 7"
  Yo La Tengo "Tom Courtenay" cd-5

            You've had your fun, you don't get well no more.

1995 was a frustrating year, I think!  Remember they guy who recently
posted his top lists to chugchanga?  The one whose list was filled
with stuff like Jim O'Rourke and Organum?  If I had heard all those
albums, a lot of them would probably be in my list too.  Also if the
new Trumans Water album is out, as I have the impression is the case,
it surely would have made the list.  And if I had heard the double
albums of 1995 by Dolomite, Cul de Sac, and Stereolab, each of those
might have made my list.

And on the list of shorter releases, anything by A Minor Forest from 1995
should be in my list.  I only was able to check their 12" EP, and it was
recorded in Spetember of 1994.  Also "Ufonic" by Sabalon Glitz (on Trixie
Records) would make the list, but I couldn't tell when it came out (i know it
was near the beginning of 1995).  And finally, if I had better axxess to
releases on Bad Vugum, both of my lists would probably be inundated with their
material!

Recently I've been playing Sex Pistols "Never Mind The Bollocks" (a new find
for me), Hellhammer's masterpiece from 1984 "Apocalyptic Raids" (Metal
Blade/Noise), and the amazing "Bonded By Blood" by Exodus (1985,
Combat/Torrid).  Also a lot of random techno.

<I>[later... -dougo]</I>

Just for your information, a lot of that music I put in my list I am a bit
wishy washy about.  I mean, I thinkit's all good, and I like it all, but there
seems to be a void.  However, just in case you haven't heard these, there are
two releases I listed that I would heartily recommend as completely great:

"Hygiene" (and everything else) by Radiopuhelimet, just about the best and
harshest hardcore band I know of.  Rather spectacular.

and

"Heyday 1979-1983", the retrospective double CD by The Embarrassment.
This is totally amazing.  It's plain pop-punk/rock music, but it's so expertly
crafted I can barely believe it.  Everything is fun and exciting even when
it's quite repetitive kuz all the members are fantastic at their instruments
AND they're creative and dynamic songwriters.  I can easily hear the beginning
rumble of the current indierock scene in The Embarrassment (in fact a couple
of their tapes were on the early 80's version of Sub Pop!)  I keep meaning to
ask the Poster Children if they know of The Embarrassment.  I expect Rick will
say he listened to it all the time in college.

ciao!
