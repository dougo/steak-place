Thanks to everyone who submitted lists. I have only just now finished the LP
tally; I'm not sure if I will get around to doing any other lists, since they
(7"s, live, EPs) are really spotty and not everyone turned one in. But i know
how you all love these things (kaff, kaff), so they may be along eventually.

   Forty people submitted lists, which is just over 10% of Chug's population.
I was disappointed by this small sampling, although if it had been 150 I
would have been doing this until June. But what's really troublesome is that
the contributors were all male (with the possible exception of Robin
Edgerton, whose gender I cannot determine from his/her name <I>[she's
female --dougo]</I>). Next year maybe I'll kick in some much-needed affirmative
action. 

thanks again for all the lists.

yours

patrick
