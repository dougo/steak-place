Sorry that this is late; I had lost your address and had to go back
through old digests to pull it out.  I can't think of 20 records. Here's
10, in no order other than how they occurred to me:

Blonde Redhead _In an Expression of the Inexpressible_ LP (Touch and Go)
The Monorchid _Who Put Out the Fire?_ LP (Touch and Go)
Don Caballero _What Burns Never Returns_ LP (Touch and Go)
Shellac _Terraform_ LP (Touch and Go)
Burning Witch _Towers_ LP (Slap-a-Ham)
Autechre _ae_ CD (Nothing)
Cypress Hill _Tequila Sunrise_ 12" (Columbia/Ruff House)
Spaceboy _Getting Warm on the Trail of Heat_ LP (Frenetic)
Cave In _Until Your Heart Stops_ LP (Hydra Head)
Bedhead _Transactos de Novo_ LP	 (Trance Syndicate)

- Justin

PS - In a sort of unrelated note, given that this is the end of the
millenium and all that, have you considered doing a 20 best records of
the 1000's (meaning that they would be released between 1/1/1000 and
12/31/1999)?  As far as taking a look back at what records one may have
missed by comparing against similar tastes, I would love to see it. 
Thanks again for compiling this information...
