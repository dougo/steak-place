Subject: Better Late Than Never? My Top 20
Date: Tue, 2 Feb 1999 21:34:43 -0500

Clearly it says something about my evolving tastes in rock music when the
two albums I played most last year were a Bob Wills tribute and a Chemical
Brothers DJ mix. Not to mention that the entirety of four of my top 20
picks was recorded before I'd ever bought my first record. And a quarter of
my list is derived from those longtime dietary staples Pussy Galore and the
Mekons. More than ever, and somewhat alarmingly in retrospect, new rock
albums that interested me seemed in short supply, especially in comparision
to the impulse which keeps driving me backwards to explore music I missed
the first time around. What yen I had for new music seems to have
manifested itself in nascent explorations in electronica &amp; DJ music. Dunno
how those will hold up ten years on, but to paraphrase a great philosopher,
they kept the glide in my stride and the dip in my hip.

Anyway, here 'tis:

Beck _Mutations_ CD (DGC)
Billy Bragg &amp; Wilco - Mermaid Avenue CD (Elektra)
Chemical Brothers _Brothers Gonna Work It Out_ CD (Astralwerks)
Cornelius _Fantasma_ CD (Matador)
