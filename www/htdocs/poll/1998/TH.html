Doug-

Go for it...I noticed 2 grammatical errors I fixed, so please use this list
below...I can't remember many other new releases I bought in 1998 worthy of
mention.  I did add things at the end as a best of the rest type thing to
make 20

TOP 10 MUSIC STUFF FROM 1998
 &gt; (no particular order)
 &gt; 
 &gt; Get Back Records - Italian label that re-issued several LPs from ESP-Disk.
 &gt; They not only did an excellent job in trying to maintain the original art of
 &gt; these 60s Free Jazz recordings, but they pressed all the LPs on high quality
 &gt; 180-gram vinyl!  My next request is that they try to snap up the legendary
 &gt; and way overpriced collector BYG Jazz and new music series from the 70s.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Lhasa Cement Plant - Live at the Cooler, NYC. I read about this band in an
 &gt; article about Brian Doherty in Opprobrium - formed in the late 70s by Brian
 &gt; Doherty (electronics guy on first Borbetomagus LP) and Borbeto’s guitarist
 &gt; Donald Miller. They sounded interesting and I was tempted to buy one of
 &gt; their self released CD on Warm-O-Brisk Label. They had their first reunion
 &gt; at the Terrastock Fest in Rhode Island.  This show at the Cooler, a year
 &gt; later, was their second reunited show.  Really great full out electronic
 &gt; noise with a steady fierce drum beat by Stix Donelly.  A real event!
 &gt; 
 &gt; Peter Kowald and Jin Hi Kim Quartet - Live at the 1998 Vision Festival, May
 &gt; 1998 NYC.  Beautiful string quartet with Kowald on bass, Jin Hi Kim on Asian
 &gt; stringed instrument, Xu Feng Xia (from the Tzadik CDs) on another stringed
 &gt; instrument and German violinist Gunda Gottshcalk.  (I am a bit embarrassed
 &gt; that I don’t remember the Asian Instrument, but its 6 months ago).  I did
 &gt; not know what to expect, but this was definitely one of the improv
 &gt; highlights for me this year.  They performed a fantastic hour long piece
 &gt; with each person keeping the pace…Gottschalk in particular amazed me with
 &gt; her equal attacks of the violin and her classically trained playing.  Peter
 &gt; Kowald says they plan to record for a European label, the name escapes me.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The Devil Dogs and The Dictators - Live, Halloween, Upstairs at Nicks,
 &gt; Philadelphia.  Even though I’ve seen both bands play better, I had a blast!
 &gt; The Devil Dogs reunited for the first time since ’93 or ’94 for this show 
 &gt; and a bunch of my friends drove down to the show from New York…it was one 
 &gt; big party!!!
 &gt; 
 &gt; Doug Snyder and Bob Thompson "The Daily Dance" CD (Warm-O-Brisk) -
 &gt; Originally released in 1973 on Carla Bley’s New Music Distribution Service
 &gt; imprint, this 4-track basement noise duo is a mind blower.  It was
 &gt; re-released by Brian Doherty’s label this year.  Guitar and drums improv
 &gt; that sounds quite contemporary in the Fushitsusha and Sonny Sharrock vein
 &gt; from two Stooges and free jazz influenced punks in Fayette County, Ohio.
 &gt; Word has it that they still jam now and again in Ohio.
 &gt; 
 &gt; The Tiwnkeyz "Aliens in our Midst - Complete Recordings from 1977-80"
 &gt; (Anopheles Records) - Jam packed CD of all the studio recordings by this
 &gt; Sacramento psych punk band.  Songs about aliens, mysticism and cartoon
 &gt; lands.  Strong Velvet Underground, T. Rex and Syd Barrett influence with
 &gt; over-the-top guitar licks from Tom Darling.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Pere Ubu "Ubu Unchained CD (Punk Vault) - Previously unreleased live
 &gt; recordings from 2 shows; 6 songs from 1975 as Ubu’s first incarnation,
 &gt; "Rocket from the Tombs" with that punk guitar, folk-lore legend guy, Peter
 &gt; Laughner.  The remaining 7 tunes are from 1976.  Includes all the early
 &gt; hits, "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo" "Final Solution" "Heart of Darkness" "Life
 &gt; Stinks" 
 &gt; 
 &gt; The Real Kids and The Dictators - New Years Eve at Coney Island High ,NYC.
 &gt; What can I say, The Real Kids were smokin’.  John Felice (as a friend
 &gt; pointed out, he looked just like Dee Dee Ramone) had all the angry you punk
 &gt; attitude and snarl like it was the 70s all over again.  They played all the
 &gt; hits and didn’t waste any time with mediocre new tunes (thankfully).
 &gt; Felice’s solos were absolutely screamin’ and they brought in the New Year
 &gt; with a bang!  The Dictators were a great party too, go figure.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Joe Morris Quartet - December at the Old Office, Knitting Factory, NYC.
 &gt; Beautiful quartet of guitar, violin, bass and drums.  I must admit that I’m
 &gt; used to hearing the lyrical and squeadeldeehonk lines of free sax
 &gt; players…this was a wonderful change of pace.  Joe Morris is one of the best
 &gt; guitarists out there.  Playing both sharp staccato and swift light scales,
 &gt; Morris could shift gears seamlessly in each strongly composed tune.  Check
 &gt; out the new CD on AUM Fidelity for this same line up.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Test - Various times and places throughout 1998 in New York.  This free jazz
 &gt; trio/quartet can bee seen in at least two public spots blowin’ their free
 &gt; sounds as if it was 1967 and the New Music was the Now Music.  These players
 &gt; have been in the improv music scene since the 70s loft era and play their
 &gt; hearts out each and every time I’ve seen them.  Daniel Carter on reeds and
 &gt; flute can be seen around town in several other bands, including "Other
 &gt; Dimensions in Music" and Sabir Mateen on tenor can be heard in several of
 &gt; his own bands as well as a sideman for Raphe Malik.  Word has it that
 &gt; Thurston Moore is releasing a CD by the group on Ecstatic Peace.  My
 &gt; favorite place to hear "Test" is at the Astor Place stop on the 6 line
 &gt; during rush hour.  Loads of people are pouring out of their train to get
 &gt; home after a long day at work, only to be met at the platform by blistering
 &gt; group improvisation letting the demons of the day loose-poetry!
 &gt; 
_______________________________
Best of the rest - consider these all number 10 on my top 10 list

Murder Punk CDs Vol 1 and 2 (Murder Punk Inc.) - 2 excellent comps of Aussie
punk singles, 1977-80.  Classics like The Victims' "Television Addict",
Psycho Surgeons "Horizontal Action" and Fun Things' "Savage".  With the
proliferation of the "later" mediocre Killed By Death and Bloodstains comps,
pick up these CDs and get the real thing!...come to think of it, this should
be in my top 10, oh well.

The Figgs "Couldn't Get High" CD (Absolute Au Go-Go) - They've been dropped
from 2 majors and put out their best yet on this indie label.  With this
much talent, experience and high energy power pop, producing their own
record was DEFINITELY the way to go

Other Dimensions in Music Live at Tonic and their AUM Fidelity CD release

William Parker In Order to Survive "Compassion Seizes Bed-Stuy" (Homestead
Records) - Word has it that Steven Joerg was responsible for the improv jazz
released on Homestead.  Be sure to check out his new and great label AUM
Fidelity (see above).  This CD marks one of my favorite ensembles to record
free jazz this year - Cooper Moore on piano, William Parker on bass and the
new young star of the scene, Susie Ibarra on drums lock into intricate and
steady rhythms throughout.

Sir Richard Bishop "Salvador Kali" CD (Revenant) - 1/3 of Sun City Girls'
assault on sound, Rick Bishop serves up an excellent instrumental CD.  He
gets my vote as one of the best, if not the best guitarist out there.

Menace "G.L.C." LP (Get Back?) - A compilation of all of Menace's singles
from the late 70s.  Includes such toe tappers as "Insane Society", "Screwed
Up", "Live for Today".  The only Oi band I'll listen to, probably because it
was the real shit, before Oi took off to adolescent testosterone dreamin'.

Pussy Galore reissues on Matador - I must admit that I had some sort of
snobby reaction to Pussy Galore the first time around; maybe it was their
New York junky art poser attitude.  So I never bought those now ridiculously
overpriced orginal LPS; how is it that a record from ten to fifteen years
ago can be fetching $50-$75??!! Thank you Matador for re-releasing these
seminal 80s records and letting me get my act together and buy these the
second time around.  These guys are up there with the Gories for the best in
fucked up, sloppy, garage punk!!

Bader Ali Khan at the Summer stage at Central Park, NYC - The late Nusrat
Fati Ali Khan's lesser known cousin is taking up the ranks in Qawwali music.
This Sufi devotional needs to be heard live with Pakistani listeners
clapping and chanting in time, raising their spirits.  I wish I knew what he
was singing, but the music and voices were beautiful nonetheless.  The
second performer, a woman whose name escapes me, lead another Qawwali group.
Apparently, it is somewhat rare for a woman to lead a group; this, along
with her absolutely incredible voice improvisations, is probably why the
audience reached an even higher level with her performance.

Jameel Moondoc Quintet - Live at the Old Office, Knitting Factory, Fall 1998
/ Jameel Moondoc Quartet, Featuring Andrew Cyrille, Knitting Factory Main
Space, Dec. 1998 -  Wonderful alto sax player that needs more attention.

3rd Annual Vision Festival - May 18-25 Orensanz Art Center, NYC. An amazing
improv music, dance and art festival held in a unique former Jewish Temple.
Aside from Peter Kowald (see above) I saw a great trio led by Tim Berne,
post-Ayler newcomer Assif Tsahar and his wife Susie Ibarra, Roy Campbell's
Other Dimensions in Music , Joseph Jarman's spiritual ensemble with Myra
Melford and a beautiful duet of Matthew Shipp and William Parker.  This
festival is an essential for ANYONE interested in free jazz and improv
music! FUCK THE TEXACO JAZZ FEST!!

There you have it...I'm sure there is some stuff I've left out.  My mind has
a hard time remembering all the events of 1998...these are what popped up.
