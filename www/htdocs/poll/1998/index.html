<H1><HR><a href="voters.html">Chugchanga-L Members</a>' Favorite
Records of 1998</H1>

Okay, here are the REAL results from the 1998 poll.  (I hope you
enjoyed the <a href="fake.html">April Fools list</a> as much as I
did...)  <p>

Quick summary of the rules: subscribers were asked to send me lists of up
to 20 of their favorite records released in 1998 (or late 1997), of
any length and in any format.  Compilations and box sets were allowed,
but reissues and bootlegs were not.  Special exceptions were made for 
Bob Dylan's <cite>Royal Albert Hall</cite>, which was a reissue of a
bootleg, and Sleep's <cite>Jerusalem</cite>, which was given an
official release in early 1999 on The Music Cartel (it got 4 votes).
