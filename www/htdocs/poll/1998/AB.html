Subject: Doug O. 1.5.98 Top not-quite 20 records of 1998
Date: Wed, 6 Jan 1999 01:51:46 EST

I was out of it and/or out of the country for a large chunk of this year and
spent far less money and attention to new records than I have in a long time.
Most of my favorite records this year were old ones. Here, however, are a
handful of new records which I own and which I like. I have a feeling
something by Timbaland and the new Rufus Wainwright and Lucinda Williams
records would be on my list if I owned 'em, but I don't. So...

All Scars CD (Dischord/Slowdime) 1997?
Autechere _not sure of the title; the new record_ CD (Nothing/Warp)
Clem Snide _You Were A Diamond_ CD (Tractor Beam) 1997?
Dump _That Skinny Motherfucker With the High Voice_ cassette (Shrimper)
Bob Dylan _Live: 1966_ CD (Sony)
Lauryn Hill _The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill_ CD (Ruffhouse)
Hole _Celebrity Skin_ CD (DGC)
Massive Attack _Mezzanine_ CD (Virgin)
Neutral Milk Hotel _In the Airplane Over the Sea_ CD (Merge)
Pulp _This is Hardcore_ CD (Island)
The Push Kings _Far Places_ CD (Sealed Fate)
Quasi _Featuring "Birds"_ CD (Up)
Silver Jews _American Water_ CD (Drag City)
Elliott Smith _XO_ CD (Dreamworks)
Amon Tobin _Permutation_ (Ninja Tune)
