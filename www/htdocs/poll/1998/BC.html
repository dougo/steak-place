Doug --

Your "don't shy away from major label releases and guilty pleasures has
caused me to delurk to enter the end-of-year poll.  Hope it's not too
late, I've been out of town for awhile.  A few of these (Hersh, NMH, PJam)
may be 1997, but were things that I picked up in `98 (and I don't have
them here to double-check).  If you know better, feel free to delete them.

Looking forward to the results,
-Brad
