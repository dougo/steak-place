Greetings Doug,

I present my list of 1998 records I especially enjoyed.

Tairikuotoko Vs. Sanmyakuonna, _Viva Young Florida_ (Magaibutsu)
Quasi, _Featuring 'Birds'_ (Up)
Trumans Water, _Fragments Of A Lucky Break_ (Emperor Jones/Trance Syndicate)
Unwound, _Challenge For A Civilized Society_ (Kill Rock Stars)
Ruins, _Symphonica_ (Tzadik)
Ruins, _Vrresto_ (Magaibutsu)
Pilgrims, _Beans, Birdies, Men, Mooses, Ants, Monsters &amp; Trees_ (Poprockit)
A Minor Forest, _Inindependence_ (Thrill Jockey)
Robert Wyatt, _Shleep_ (Thirsty Ear)
Poster Children, _"Copyright"_ (self-released)
godheadSilo, _Share The Fantasy_ (Sub Pop)
Gastr Del Sol, _Camofleur_ (Drag City)
Uzeda, _Different Section Wires_ (Touch &amp; Go)
Cornelius, _Fantasma_ (Matador)
Neutral Milk Hotel, _In The Aeroplane Over The Sea_ (Merge)
Six Finger Satellite, _Law Of Ruins_ (Sub Pop)
Don Caballero, _What Burns Never Returns_ (Touch &amp; Go)

These are in no particular order, except the first.  Tairikuotoko Vs.
Sanmyakuonna, which translates to "The Continental Men vs. The Mountain
Range Women", is a side project involving Tatsuya Yoshida of Ruins.  "Viva
Young Florida" is by far the most unusual and new-sounding record I heard
from 1998.  It's chaotic and crazy, like a commune using traditional, rock,
and electronic music to celebrate and comment on society and run a circus
all at once.  Also, I was pleased that bands such as Trumans Water, Gastr
del Sol, Don Caballero, and Unwound continue to produce thoroughly enjoyable
records.  As usual, I am nearly certain new records by Bad Vugum bands would
have topped the list had I heard them.  Radiopuhelimet made an album in
1998: "Hiljaista" ("Quiet").

Here are some 1998 records which I expect would have been in contention for
the above list if only I had heard them:

Radiopuhelimet Hiljaista (Bad Vugum)
Fushitsusha - Gold Blood (Charnel)
Sleep - Jerusalem (?)
R.L. Burnside - Come On in (Fat Possum)
Godspeed You Black Emperor - f#a# Infinity (Kranky)
Ultra Bide - Super Milk (Alternative Tentacles)
Guv'ner - Spectral Worship (Merge)
Soft Machine - Virtually (Cuneiform)
Ex - Starters Alternators (Touch &amp; Go)
June Of 44 - Four Great Points (Touch &amp; Go)
Trans Am - The Surveillance (Thrill Jockey)
DJ Spooky - Riddim Warfare (Outpost)
Royal Trux - Accelerator (Drag City)
Shellac - Terraform (Touch &amp; Go)
Tortoise - TNT (Thrill Jockey)

This year I also listened to lots of Chinese music, throat-singing, and
authentic country and  country-related music on the Crazy Cajun label. 
Everything I know of from Crazy Cajun is from 1977-1978.  Among the
highlights are: Doak Snead ("Think Of Me Sometime"), Jesse Lankford, Glenn
Stillman ("Parody Of The Mountain Climber"), and Mexican Blood.
