<HR><H1>Chugchanga-L Poll 1999 Eligibility Rules</H1>

    <p>
      <strong>Any</strong> record officially released or reissued in
      1999 is eligible, regardless of format, length, label, genre, or
      original recording date.  "Official" here means no bootlegs and
      no promo-onlys; the idea is to keep it restricted to records
      that are reasonably possible to legally acquire.  Records
      released in late 1998 are also eligible, within reason; a good
      rule of thumb is that if it appeared in
      <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dougo/poll/1998/byartist.html">last year's poll results,</a>
      then it's not eligible for this year's poll (unless it was
      re-released).
    </p>

    <p>
      Please don't censor yourself when choosing your favorite records
      of the year.  There's no standard of "indie-ness" to conform to,
      and guilty pleasures are perfectly valid.  You also shouldn't be
      afraid to list records you had some part in making;
      self-promotion is fine if you feel your record belongs in your
      top 20.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that <strong>order does not matter</strong> in your poll
      list, nor do you have to submit exactly 20 records; I will
      simply take the top 20 (or however many there are if fewer) from 
      each list and count one vote per record per poll entry.
    </p>
