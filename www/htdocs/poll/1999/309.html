This list is a little different than a similar one I posted to Droneon, but the thrust is the same.
Last year was a solid year for interesting music with guitars, even if nothing truly massive
hit the stage. Half Film and Juno are both avatars of a sort of relaxed, moody form of emo,
where much of the loud has been extracted from the soft / loud / soft progression. I don't
think they're anything so special, but I sure did listen to them a lot last year. I was amazed
by how much I enjoyed the Rushmore soundtrack, and in large part it was the thing I
liked best about that movie. And Abigor and Solefald could be counted upon to represent
the future sound of (what was formerly known as) black metal.
<p>
I am constitutionally incapable of not liking a release with Michael Gira associated with it,
and I liked all the Leonard Cohen influences written all over _New Mother_. Enough said
about that. _A Single History_ condenses everything I like about Unwound into one
pleasant, portable package. Built To Spill have managed to condense the pretty parts of
_Perfect From Now On_ with the tuneful pop songs of _There's Nothing Wrong With Love_
and the result is pretty much perfect.
<p>
And, on another level, the Roots do for refined modern hip hop what Prodigy did for
dirty old-school beats and breaks. One's classicist and the other is relentlessly
populist, yet I like both of them about the same. Life is full of irony.
