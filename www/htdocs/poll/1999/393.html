I waited until the last minute because I had hoped I might actually
get more 1999 records in January, but that didn't happen.  Here's my
list in no particular order:

<dl>
<dt>Apples (in Stereo) "Her Wallpaper Reverie" (SpinArt LP)
	<dd>Maybe not as good as "Tone Soul Evolution" but still very nice.

<dt>Atom & His Package "Making Love" (No Idea LP)
	<dd>Cheating somewhat since I haven't heard the whole thing yet,
	but the parts I have heard would easily make up for any amount of
	suck the other songs might have (which is a long shot, I think).

<dt>Built to Spill "Keep It Like A Secret" (Warner Bros CD)
	<dd>Would be #1 if this were in order.

<dt>Os Mutantes "A Divina Comedia Ou Ando Meio Desligado" (Omplatten CD)
	<dd>Is this supposed to be the "weak" one?  I haven't heard the others.

<dt>Pavement "Terror Twilight" (Matador LP)
	<dd>Does not suck nearly as badly as I had been led to believe.

<dt>Stereolab "Cobra And Phases Group Play Voltage In The Milky Night"
	(Duphonic 2xLP)
	<dd>Stereolab makes my list just about every year.
</dl>

Obligitory excellent record from last year that didn't make my last list:

<dl><dt>Elliott Smith "XO" (Bongload LP)
</dl>
