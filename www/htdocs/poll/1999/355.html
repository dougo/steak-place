<P>
Ten records only; I just haven't been buying new records the way I used to.  It's interesting,
though, that records I put in my '97 list showed up as domestic issues in '99 (cf the Air
singles comp).  In fact, that Hood record came out in '94 -- I love Hood, so I used the CD
reissue to fill out the round number.
<p>
GYBEmperor: believe the hype.  See http://www.brainwashed.com/godspeed/
<p>
Pedro: bought it for the sleeve -- pleasant surprise of the year.  Odd, moody electropop.
Apparently a side project by the guitarist for a hipper band (Dakota Oka Trio) I am not
cool enough to know anything about.  A fine record.
<p>
Clinic: who are these folks?  Great, great singles comp.
<p>
Brinkmann: incredibly consistent electronic/vinyl experimenter.
<p>
EISound: postrock, but a really nice record.
<p>
Beta Band: not as immediate as their '97 debut, but the LP grows on you.
<p>
WOHarry: fine, wish-I-were-Syd stuff by ex-Weather Prophet.
<p>
Tindersticks: not perhaps their best ever, but good, and -- whew -- upbeat!
<p>
Waits: a pal plays drums on a few tracks.  Plus, it's good.
<p>
Hood: longtime fanboy must-own.
<p>
Cheers,
<p>
