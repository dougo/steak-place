Hi Doug, these are some records i really enjoyed over the year, they re all
full lengths (in alphabetical order):
A Minor Forest: Flemish altruism...(Thrill Jockey)
Chavez: Ride the fader (Matador)
Couch: Etwas benutzen (Kollaps/(Naptime?))
Directions in Music (Thrill Jockey)
DJ Shadow: Endtroducing (MoWax)
Mark Eitzel: 60 Watt Silver Lining
Gallon Drunk: The Long Still Night (City Slang/?)
Karate: s/t (Southern)
Low: The curtain hits the cast (Vernon Yard)
Madelines: Your motives kill me (Sudden Shame)
Mineral: The power of failing (crank!)
Rachels: The Sea and the Bells (1/4Stick)
Rex: C (Southern)
The Secret Stars: s/t (Shrimper)
The Sonora Pine: s/t (1/4Stick)
Texas is the reason: Do you know who you are?(Revelation)
Tortoise: Millions now living...(Thrill Jockey)
V.A.:Lounge Ax Defense...(Touch & Go)
Versus: Secret Swingers (Caroline)

Admittedly not a very specific german choice, but I m sure that some of the
others will add their part of Oval, Microstoria, Atari Teenage Riot or
whatever...

sophisticated way)
