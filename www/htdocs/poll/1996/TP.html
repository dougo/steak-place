Subject: Chug Poll '96 - my submission
Date: Mon, 13 Jan 1997 18:18:48 -1812

My list, in no particular order:

Iceburn - Meditavolutions (Revalation)
Modest Mouse - This is a Long Drive... (Up!)
Chavez - Ride the Fader (Matador)
Warmers - s/t (Dischord)
Hurl - A Place Called Today (My Pal God/Third Gear)
UI - The Sharpie 12" (Soul Static Sound)
Nels Cline Trio - Chest (Little Brother)
Evergreen - s/t (Hi-Ball)
Dis-  - The Historically Troubled Third Album (Sonic Bubblegum/My Pal God)
Silkworm - "Never Met a Man I Didn't Like" 7"
Davenport - Big Ticket Plus (Peas Kor)
Scott Paulsen/Jim Krenn - Twisted (WDVE Pittsburgh)

  -explanation:  Scott and Jim are the morning DJ's at WDVE 102.5 fm
    in Pittsburgh.  The station format is AOR, which i prefer to the lame
    "New Rock" (tm) format of their sister station...  anyway, these guys
    are the real deal.  Both are hometown boys, are super freindly in person,
    and are seriously funny, albeit sometimes corny.  For each of the past
    few Christmas seasons the station has released a compilation of morning
    show comedy - interviews, skits, inpromptu laughs, corny songs, etc.
    Much of the comedy can only be appreciated by current or recent Pittsburgh
    residents, as many impersonations are of local media folks, atheletes,
    politicians, etc.  The CDs and tapes are sold super cheap at a local record
    store chain, and proceeds go to Animal Friends, Children's Hospital, and
    other local charities.

Boy's Life - Departures and Landfalls (Cargo)
  - could've been recorded better, though...

Kerosene 454 - (Dischord/Slowdime)
Unwound - "Corpse Pose" single (Kill Rock Stars)
  - I wasn't extremely taken by the whole Repition LP, but I think this may
be my favorite song from last year...

Scenic - Acquatica (IPR/World Domination)
Cul de Sac - China Gate (?)
Golden - "Chet's Jalopy" single (Pro Teen, I think...)
Karl Hendricks Trio - For a While, It Was Funny (Merge)
Jon Spencer Blues Explosion - Now I Got Worry (Matador)

Honorable Mention - Railroad Jerk _Third Rail_, Yo La Tengo _Genius + Love
=_ (both on Matador), Metamatics s/t (Dischord), Palace _Arise Therefore__
(Cargo), Guided by Voices _Under the Bushes Under the Stars_ (Matador),
Grifters _Ain't my Lookout_ (Sub Pop), The VSS CD (?)

Slight disappointment, but I won't sell it or anything:
Silkworm _Firewater_ (Matador)   could've trimmed the shit and made one
great single LP instead
Arcwelder _Entropy_ (Touch n Go)  I don't hate it, but something's missing
this time

Big Disappointment:
New Bomb Turks _Scared Straight_ (Epitaph)
dis- broke up
the Steelers (technically 1st week of 1997, but you could see it coming...)
