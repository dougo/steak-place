just under the deadline!

doug - hope this comes out ok, format-wise.  i really should have dug through the bins
 AT  home a little more thoroughly, since this list has some titles that, although i liked,
clearly aren't totally strong records (thinking fellers, jessamine, tortoise, bedhead,
others) - not too many things really floored me this year, but there were some nice
surprises, esp the sebadoh cd, which i resisted buying for so long until i came across a
promo copy someone dumped.  i can't figure out why the able tasmans could never
find an audience; i'd much rather listen to them than tall dwarfs or the bats.  

some disappointments include the loren mazzacane table of elements cd, the peter
jefferies cd, paying $27 for the last swervedriver cd to find that they lost most of what
made them good, not landing a copy of the surface of the earth 2lp, having the ad
read like john fahey was headlining and then him playing for only ~40 minutes,
watching the charalambides self-destruct onstage, and moving out of the city only to
find that no bars/restaurants carry tremont ale out where i live...

i didn't bother dragging out any singles, i guess, because there were so few memorable
ones.  maybe it's also because i am tiring of tracking down singles, playing them once
and then stuffing them in a box.

enough of my prattle:
