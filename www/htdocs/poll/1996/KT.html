Hi Doug,
Happy Groundhog Eve!  Is it too late for another poll entry?  If not...


Once again, I didn't do nearly the volume of listening that I would have liked
to have, and not being a (published) critic/radio DJ/lottery winner has
limited my access as well.  That being said, here are 10 things that
distanced me from
boredom in '96:

Stereolab                Emperor Tomato Ketchup          Elektra
various artists          Runner                          Next Best Way (NZ)
Flying Saucer Attack     In Search of Spaces (live)      Corpus Hermeticum (NZ)
Thinking Fellers UL282   I Hope It Lands                 Communion 
various artists          Monsters Robots & Bug Men       Virgin (UK)
Ursa Minor               Number One (12" mini-LP)        Autopia
Shadow Ring              Put The Music In Its Coffin     Siltbreeze
Sweet & Honey            Live At Your Cosmic Mind        The Now Sound
Sub Arachnoid Space      Delicate Membrane               Charnel Music
Pendulum Floors          Whatever Happened To The...?    Villa Villakula

Some great shows I caught but didn't hear any '96 recordings from were: Cul De
Sac, Cindy Dall, Dirty Three, El-Ron, Fully Celebrated Orchestra, Juneau,
Barbara Manning, Roger Miller, Pretty Flowers, Thela, Verago-go, and Wormdoom.
Watch for these ("me"-related things) in '97: Abunai!, Cloud Furnace,
Jasmine Love Bomb, Lothars, and Prefab Messiahs.
