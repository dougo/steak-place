Ye Olde Pollster Sir Doug Orleans:

Taking part in my first Year in Review Chug Poll, thus I shall keep it
really simple as well.  But enough of idle chit-chat...

Alone in the Dark: most frequently played new purchases of new
releases in 1996, alphabetically sorted for no reason other than to impose
an order other than my own...

1. American Analog Set, the fun of watching fireworks, lp, Trance
2. Bardo Pond, *tests for new swords,* 7 in, Siltbreeze
3. Bardo Pond, amanita, dbl lp, Matador
4. Bedhead, Beheaded, lp, Trance
5. Bruce Russell, POISON + LIE$ = MONEY + DEATH, 7 in, Crank
Automotive (Possibly end of 1995)
6. Demolition Doll Rods, *I wanna OD,* 7 in, Bag of Hammers
(Possibly end of 1995)
7. Dust/Omit, Deformed, lp, Corpus Hermeticum
8. Flying Saucer Attack, live cd, Corpus Hermeticm
9. Harry Pussy, Ride a Dove, lp, Siltbreeze
10. June of 44, Tropics and Meridians, lp, Quarterstick Records
11. Neutral Milk Hotel, On Avery Island, lp, Merge
12. pavement, pacific trim, dbl 7 in, Matador
13. Peter Jefferies, Elevator Madness, lp, Emperor Jones
14. Thela, Argentina, lp, Ecstatic Peace
15. Thinking Fellers Union Local 282, I Hope it Lands, lp, Communion
16. Tortoise, Millions Now Living Will Never Die, lp, Thrill Jockey
17. Un, *Trans-missions,* 7 in, Siltbreeze
18. v/a, Harmony of the Spheres, triple lp, Drunken Fish
19. v/a, Osaka International Pirate Radio, cd, Exile Osaka Recordings
20. left blank to account for at least one of the undoubtably hundreds if
not thousands of things I unfortunately did not hear...

1996 New albums, same old tricks: Sebadoh, Jon Spencer Blues
Explosion, Guided By Voices (not that their albums were of an inferior
quality or sucked by any strecth of the imagination, just seems like each
is capable of something a bit more interesting...)

Best 20+ year old band I never heard of before to rule my world once
encountered: Brainticket, s/t debut from 1972.  Oh my.

1997 Anticipations: The supposed April release of the new Dead C
album Tusk, and for the Blitzkrieg of music media to realise that the only
thing ironic about Alanis Morissette is her career come 1998.

They*re taking me back to my little room now---bret
