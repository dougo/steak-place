In no particular order:

Cow-N-Tax  demo cassette (not sure of the label since it's in Japanese)
        Killer Japanese punk rock. Lo-Fi goodness

Jabon- Ambulatory Paranoia cassette (Gravelvoice P.O. Box 45066 Seattle WA
98145)
        Yeah, I recorded it! I don't get to listen to much since I'm
recording all the time. So it goes without         saying that some of my
favorite stuff will be personal projects. This cassette is a combination of
metal riffs, gamelan, Chrome and Black Flag.

Climax Golden Twins- Imperial Household Orchestra CD (Scratch 109 West
Cordova St. Vancouver BC         V6B 1E1 Canada)
        Ambient, experimental, sonic headcleaner. Gentle, harsh, flowing and
rocking.

Mike Bisio- Covert Choreography CD (Cadence Redwood, NY 13679)
        It's been a long time since I've heard a really great jazz record
that didn't come out in the 50's or 60's.

Various Artist- You Gan't Boar like an Eabla when you Work with Turkrys CD
(Amarillo  P.O. Box 24433         San Francisco, CA 94124)
        Compilation of Amarillo Artists including unreleased tracks by Sun
City Girls and Heavenly Ten         Stems. Just an all around great intro to
the eclectic Amarillo catalog.

Secret Chiefs Trio- First Grand Constitution and Bylaws CD (Amarillo)
        This is Mr. Bungle minus Patton. It blows Mr. Bungle away which is
hard to do.

Various Artist- Deep in the Heart of Tuva CD (Ellipse Arts  20 Lumber Rd,
Roslyn, NY 11576)
        Great packaging! Like a little Book. Intro to Tuvan music which
demonstrates trad. melodies and         contemporary ones too. Drone On.

Frank Zappa- Plays the Music of Frank Zappa CD (UMRK  P.O. Box 5418 North
Hollywood, CA 91616)
        Another great package! Ultradeluxe with Zappa Mustache and Imperial
attached. Collection of         Signature guitar pieces. Contains the
earliest known versions of particular songs plus the officially
released version as well.

Frank Zappa- Lost Episodes CD (Barking Pumpkin)
        Genius comp of clean up tracks including a track from 1958 in which
Beefheart imitates a black,         woman soul singer with Zappa and his
brother on guitars.

Black Cat Orchestra- CD (Irene Records 2318 2nd Ave Seattle, WA 98121)
        10 piece orchestra doing trad. and original compositions which you'd
expect off your 78rpm player.

Sun City Girls- Dante's Disneyland Inferno CD (Abduction  P.O. Box 9611,
Seattle, WA 98109)
        What can I say? It's rollercoaster ride through hell as interpreted
by Charles Gocher.

COA- 7" single (Japan Overseas  6-1-21 Ueshio Tennoji-ku Osaka 543 Japan)
        Two girls, sings like Napalm Death. Heavier than Sabbath

Tortoise- Millions Now Living LP (Thrill Jockey  P.O. Box 476794, Chicago,
IL 60647)
        I think everyone knows about this.
