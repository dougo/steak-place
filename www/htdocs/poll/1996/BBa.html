My favorite records that came out in 1996 that I heard were:

Ghost,  _Lama, Rabi, Rabi_ (Drag City)
Bardo Pond, _Amanita_ (Matador)
The Tower Recordings, _The Fraternity of Moonwalkers_ (Audible Hiss)
Stereolab, _Emperor Tomato Ketchup_ (Elektra)
various artists, _Harmony of the Spheres_ (Drunken Fish)
His Name is Alive, _Stars on E.S.P_ (4AD)

I've promised myself to be slightly more on top of new stuff next year.
Part of the reason I made a point of getting the Bardo Pond and Tower Recordings
stuff is that they are friends of mine and my band Tono-Bungay did a bunch of
shows with both - I presume it's not really a conflict of interest that I've
become friends with people whose music I like.
I'd also like to give a plug to Blind Melon's _Soup_ which came out in 1995,
because I'm sure no one on Chug likes it.
I didn't much care for Everything But the Girl's _Walking Wounded_ and I thought
about including Beck on my list, but I've decided that while I appreciate it's
artistry, I don't really enjoy the record.
Thanks,
Bob Bannister
