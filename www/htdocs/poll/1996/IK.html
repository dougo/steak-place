Hi

Try as I might, I just couldn't come up with 20 records from last year
that I'd like to include in a list like this, but here's what I really
liked
in 1996, in no particular order:

V-3: Photograph Burns CD (Onion)
Pere Ubu: Datapanik in the Year Zero cd-box (DGC)
Beck: Odelay CD (DGC?)
Larry & Lefthanded: Diabolika 10" (Texicali Records)
JSBX: Now I Got Worry CD (Mute)
Isebel's Pain: Legalize It 7" (Trash Can)
Hellacopters: Supershitty to the Max CD (White Jazz)

Umm, that's it!
