You know what's hard about these polls is that the records that i <br>
might get in 2001 that I'm really, really excited about might have come out <br>
in 1995 or 1999 or 2000. I so behind sometimes that it takes awhile for me <br>
to hear certain records. I'm not asking you to make a provision, just <br>
thought that I'd mention that the records i'm most excited about are:<br>
<br>
Ulver - Themes From William Blake 1995<br>
Electric Wizard - Dopethrone 2000<br>
Winston Jarrett - Kingston Vibration 1991<br>
Hekate - self titled unknown<br>
Rain Fell Within 1999<br>
Haggard 1997<br>
Troll 1996<br>
Outkast 2000<br>
Low 1996<br>
Sound of Funk Vol 10 unknown<br>
<br>
you see what i mean! That's why most of the records on my list are ones <br>
that I recorded because A.) I heard them and they were released this year <br>
and  B.) I really really like them and play them often BUT, I make so <br>
little money that i can't buy everything I want to get, when it comes out, <br>
and I'm so busying making records that i hardly have time to listen to the <br>
handful I actually do buy in time. So I'm usually massively behind the <br>
times so to speak.<br>
