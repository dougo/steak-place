<hr><h1>Sean Howe's Chugchanga-L Poll 2001 Entry</h1>

Here's my list.<br>
I'm not saying this was a bad year for music, but four of my top five <br>
from last year (MF Doom's Operation Doomsday, The Clientele's <br>
Suburban Light, Clem Snide's Your Favorite Music, and Joe Pernice's <br>
Big Tobacco) were reissued this year, and if I counted them, they <br>
would have held their spots. Of course, if I'd counted reissues, I <br>
wouldn't have much new music at all.<br>

ALBUM COMMENTS:<br>
<br>
Ted Leo &amp; The Pharmacists, The Tyranny of Distance (Lookout):<br>
Spoon, Girls Can Tell (Merge):<br>
I'm really hoping that at least some of the critics who hail the <br>
tightly-wound rhythm loop of "Everything Hits At Once" acknowledge <br>
the song's obvious debt to Hall and Oates' "Say It Isn't So." Even if <br>
Girls Can Tell is a spot-the-influence LP, it's the only one I've <br>
ever heard to engulf skinny-tie pop 45s and digest them as catchy, <br>
crunchy power-trio anthems. And that whole "voice just like Gavin <br>
Rossdale" thing is starting to not bother me.  Does anyone else think <br>
it strange that Spoon and Ted Leo both found ways of merging Thin <br>
Lizzy and Joe Jackson? And made very different-sounding albums in the <br>
process?<br>
<br>
Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, How I Long To Feel That Summer In My Heart <br>
(Beggars Banquet):<br>
After anthologizing their own version of American folk music on the <br>
Blue Trees EP, this once-insufferable Welsh collective released this <br>
Paul Buckmaster homage. In the fall, when the album came out, I <br>
didn't much feel like listening to nostalgic yearnings. I wanted <br>
music that commiserated with me, music that had been through what I <br>
had been through: music that had been recorded last week, or <br>
yesterday. Well, obviously, I didn't listen to much music for a <br>
while. But when I returned to my stereo, How I Long To Feel That <br>
Summer rang as true as anything. Strange, since it throws back to <br>
those schlocky singer/songwriter records with which Warner Brothers <br>
once flooded the market. And yet songs that sound like lost <br>
Raspberries singles are garnered with organs, violins, and horns to <br>
update the Hippie-Dream Eulogy Statement in a way that Mercury Rev <br>
could only=8Awell, dream.<br>
<br>
Clem Snide, The Ghost of Fashion (SpinArt):<br>
Like Wilco, Clem Snide is a recently WEA-dumped rock band that's <br>
slowly moving away from its country roots. Also like Wilco, they <br>
recorded an album that's a "sonic departure", introducing new <br>
instruments and hopping from genre to genre. And like Wilco, the <br>
album sort of failed. But in Clem Snide's case, it wasn't because of <br>
the songs.<br>
(By the way: it's hard to imagine that the fervor for Yankee Foxtrot <br>
Hotel isn't a bit bolstered by a sort of "I've heard it and you <br>
haven't" exhibitionism. Let's see how the album's held up after 500 <br>
listens to "Heavy Metal Drummer.")<br>
<br>
Shins, Oh, Inverted World (Sub Pop)<br>
Stephen Malkmus and Preston School of Industry showed us the sum of <br>
Pavement's parts; maybe George Harrison's death will scare some sense <br>
into them. In the meantime, the throne of old-fashioned indie rock is <br>
about to get a new ass-mark. While The New Pornographers write catchy <br>
enough exercises, the Shins display a greater commitment to <br>
inhabiting songs, as evidenced by "New Slang." <br>

<br>
SINGLES COMMENTS:<br>
Ghostface Killah "Never Gonna Be The Same"<br>
I know that the use of tabla makes "Get Ur Freak On" most people's <br>
choice for iconoclastic hip-hop single of the year. But it can't <br>
compare to this much-hated on Trojan horse, which uses every verse to <br>
throws jaw-droppers at urban radio. A cuckolded gangsta with a broken <br>
heart envisions all the ways his lady's been getting fucked. He <br>
rationalizes his rivals' edge: "Bigger dick, I don't know." And how <br>
does he sweet-talk? "Member those days I had you smellin' my boxers?"<br>
All this goes down with a smooth Carl Thomas chorus, but one line <br>
ensured the songs' commercial doom (and brilliance): "Fuck that, I <br>
put a lot of money up-I'm hatin'!"<br>
<br>
Dido "Thank You"<br>
Can I include "Thank You"? I know it's been out for a decade or so, <br>
but it got most of its airplay this past year. I'm kind of <br>
embarrassed to list it, but Mr. Mathers appropriation of the song <br>
gave it a sinister aftertaste; you couldn't hear it without <br>
remembering how it fit in the context of "Stan." It wasn't until my <br>
girlfriend and I were on vacation in Europe, and we heard it in <br>
stores and on radios, that I started to let the song appeal to the <br>
more innocent parts of my heart. It probably would have been too <br>
saccharine, but it still had a lingering bite. So we held hands to <br>
the song and talked about how happy it made us. Then we came back to <br>
the States on September 8. Three days later, and the song's hook, "I <br>
want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life," was tainted <br>
yet again. But all that Rorschaching is the sign of a perfect pop <br>
song, right?<br>
<br>
Sunshine Anderson "Lunch and Dinner"<br>
To date, this is the most nonchalant use of the term "chickenhead" in a ball=<br>
ad.<br>
<br>
Christina Aguilera vs. The Strokes "Stroke of Genius"<br>
Who would have thought that the voice of Christina Aguilera could be <br>
used to humanize a rock band? Julian Casablancas is a good singer and <br>
all (and he does the best-ever imitation of Loaded-era Lou Reed), but <br>
enough's enough with that distortion pedal or phone filter or <br>
whatever they use on EVERY FUCKING STROKES SONG. This illicit remix <br>
moves the Strokes to Boston and turns them into a very tight Motels <br>
tribute band.<br>
