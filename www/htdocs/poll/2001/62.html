<br>
I have always admired and liked Luke Haines' music, as manifested in the<br>
Auteurs and Baader Meinhof, but I didn't LOVE LOVE LOVE it until I found<br>
my way to the Black Box Recorder records this year. The addition of<br>
supreme foils John Moore and Sarah Nixey gives Haines' vision a lovely<br>
resonance beyond his personal obsessions. The Facts of Life is<br>
frank, corny, and intoxicating.  It's also within the grasp of anyone who<br>
has grappled with ecstasy and heartbreak, which is to say the mundane<br>
process of growing up. Fondness for the concept of serial murder not<br>
required.<br>
<br>
Daniel Bejar's glam whine is a locus of all the arch white men that<br>
precede him, and his stark obsession with rock and roll across the ages<br>
feeds his movies-books-'n-records lyrics like gas feeds a campfire. On<br>
Streethawk: A Seduction, beyond the cute titles and coy<br>
quotations, Bejar's fiefdom of Destroyer spins the whole of 1970-72<br>
English rock into a dozen insanely good songs.  The tracks coalesce into<br>
a singularity that Marc Bolan would envy.<br>
<br>
Finally saw the Ex. Twice. I would go see them every week for a year if I<br>
had the chance. Dizzy Spells (like its predecessor <br>
Starters Alternators) is a remarkable transfer of uncontainable<br>
energy from the most beautiful freight train I've ever heard. I wonder<br>
where Kat will finish in the Modern Drummer poll this year.<br>
<br>
Bedhead had it all over any band to which they were ever compared (Velvet<br>
Underground excepted). From their ashes rises the New Year, whose<br>
Newness Ends has the same signature guitar chime and perfectionist<br>
arrangements.  It moves, however, with a graceful rapidity that didn't<br>
come naturally to BH. Which is to say it's different, and the same, and<br>
most of what I want to hear out of a couple-three guitars.<br>
<br>
The eponymous solo album portends many things for a newly single<br>
musician, but rarely does it result in the kind of modesty and engagement<br>
found on Stephen Malkmus. This debut alb's self-awareness and<br>
circumspect thought and shot of plain old goofiness bring out the Tom<br>
Verlaine comparisons. And maybe a bit of the guitar playing---"Church<br>
on White" is a panegyric we'd all like to have when we're gone.<br>
<br>
Basement Jaxx' "Romeo" is my single of the year---one riff so great every<br>
instrument wants to play it. The rest of Rooty has its <br>
worthy moments ("Where's Your Head At" chief among them), and if a<br>
techno-phobe like me likes it this much, the techno-phile <br>
on E must not know what to do with himself.<br>
<br>
Macy Gray has made two half-formed records, but somehow they seem like<br>
real albums to me, and they both have a couple of songs that most anyone<br>
would be glad to have written. I won't be surprised if she produces her<br>
own Call Me one of these days.  I also won't be surprised if this<br>
is as good as she gets. <br>
<br>
Dead Moon's Trash and Burn is a worthy introduction to this<br>
classic Northwest rock band, though it's hardly their best. More telling<br>
of their power was their post-9/11 tour action: watching them roar<br>
through an hour on `the weekend after' was one of the most life-affirming<br>
moments music of any kind has given me.<br>
<br>
Me, I go to movies, dinner, the odd rock show. But Pink and Missy Elliott<br>
did a nice job of giving this dork an idealized <br>
peek at the clubbing life (no babbling E-heads, no terrible music, no<br>
laser hangover). I mean...this is 'club music,' ain't it?  Are<br>
people even doing Ecstasy anymore?  Anyway, they lit up my living room<br>
for many three-minute periods between Junkyard Wars and whatever<br>
was on the Sundance Channel.<br>
