<hr><h1>Carl Zimring's Chugchanga-L Poll 2000 Entry</h1>

<br>
<a href="byartist.html#case"><strong>    1. Case, Neko &amp; Her Boyfriends, </strong><cite>Furnace Room Lullaby</cite> (Bloodshot)</a><br>
A big, beautiful voice with fine material, fine backing, fine production<br>
and easily my favorite record released this year.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#giant"><strong>    2. Giant Sand, </strong><cite>Chore of Enchantment</cite> (Thrill Jockey)</a><br>
The best record Howe Gelb's ever made balances the loose improv vibe of<br>
the band with disciplined production and great songs.  V2 deserves<br>
credit for financing this and grief for dropping them. <br>
<a href="byartist.html#yo"><strong>    3. Yo La Tengo, </strong><cite>And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out</cite> (Matador)</a><br>
A textured, clear-eyed look at a relationship, and another distinctly<br>
great YLT record.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#phelps_inland"><strong>    4. Phelps, Joel R.L.  &amp; the Downer Trio, </strong><cite>Inland Empires</cite> EP (Moneyshot)</a><br>
An incredibly sad but beautiful (and largely acoustic) record consisting<br>
of Phelps's superb interpretations of songs by the Go-Betweens, Iris<br>
DeMent, Townes Van Zandt and Steve Earle bookending his original "Now<br>
You Are Found".<br>
<a href="byartist.html#eleventh"><strong>    5. Eleventh Dream Day, </strong><cite>Stalled Parade</cite> (Thrill Jockey)</a><br>
Their most aggressive record since _El Moodio_ and a must for lovers of<br>
Crazy Horse guitar workouts.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#pinetop"><strong>    6. Pinetop Seven, </strong><cite>Bringing Home the Last Great Strike</cite> (Truckstop)</a><br>
Another lush, cinematic record from Darren Richard and a cast of thousands.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#naked"><strong>    7. Naked Omaha, </strong><cite>Belt</cite> (self-released)</a><br>
Terrific alt.country drawing from the same elements present in the first<br>
two Uncle Tupelo albums.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#mekons"><strong>    8. Mekons, </strong><cite>Journey To the End of the Night</cite> (Quarterstick)</a><br>
My favorite Mekons' record since _Curse_. <br>
<a href="byartist.html#silkworm"><strong>    9. Silkworm, </strong><cite>Lifestyle</cite> (Touch &amp; Go)</a><br>
More great stripped-down rock from one of America's best rock bands.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#zevon"><strong>    10. Warren Zevon, </strong><cite>Life'll Kill Ya</cite> (Artemis)</a><br>
One record every five years is not enough, especially since Zevon's<br>
preoccupation with infirmity and mortality makes it sound as if he's<br>
living on borrowed time.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#various_come">    11. Various Artists, _Come On Beautiful: A Tribute to American Music</a><br>
Club_ (Big Night)<br>
A coherent and highly successful collection of AMC covers by Steve Wynn,<br>
Paula Frazer, Calexico, Ida, the Willard Grant Conspiracy and likeminded<br>
artists.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#waco"><strong>    12. Waco Brothers, </strong><cite>Electric Waco Chair</cite> (Bloodshot)</a><br>
Waco records make me happy.  This is my favorite since _Cowboy in Flames_.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#driveby"><strong>    13. Drive-By Truckers, </strong><cite>Alabama Ass-Whuppin'</cite> (Second Heaven)</a><br>
Southern-fired rock recorded live in concert featuring two gifted<br>
songwriters in Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley.  Hood¹s introductions<br>
(especially for  "18 Wheels of Love") are worth the price of the album.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#willard"><strong>    14. Willard Grant Conspiracy, </strong><cite>Mojave</cite> (Slow River)</a><br>
The strongest WGC album yet.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#hogan">    15. Hogan, Kelly &amp; the Pine Valley Cosmonauts, _Beneath the Country</a><br>
Underdog_ (Bloodshot)<br>
Hogan's gift for interpretation is ably demonstrated by covers of "Papa<br>
Was a Rodeo", "Whispering Pines" and pretty much every track on this<br>
fine album.  <br>
<a href="byartist.html#dirtball"><strong>    16. Dirtball, </strong><cite>Turn Up the Barn</cite> (Planetary)</a><br>
Dirtball go out on a high note with more of Wes Freed's typically<br>
soulful singing.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#boxstep"><strong>    17. Boxstep, </strong><cite>Boxstep</cite> (self-released)</a><br>
A new band out of Pittsburgh that sounds like an indie-rock (and vocal)<br>
take on the Dirty Three.  Scratchy from the Deliberate Strangers fiddles<br>
all over this record.<br>
<a href="byartist.html#sea"><strong>    18. Sea and Cake, The, </strong><cite>Oui</cite> (Thrill Jockey)</a><br>
My favorite of theirs since _Nassau_. <br>
<a href="byartist.html#roll"><strong>    19. Roll, Jim </strong><cite>Lunette</cite> (New West)</a><br>
Another strong set of songs by Roll, produced by Walter Salas-Humara. <br>
<a href="byartist.html#prophet"><strong>    20. Prophet, Chuck </strong><cite>The Hurting Business</cite> (Hightone) </a><br>
Prophet mixes beats into his Americana with excellent results,<br>
especially on "Dyin' All Young".<br>
