<hr><h1>Tim Midgett's Chugchanga-L Poll 2000 Entry</h1>

here's what i sent to pazz and jop poll in village voice<br>
-------------------------<br>
Maybe I'm getting old--well, OK, I'm _definitely_ getting old--but for<br>
whatever reason, little of the modern music I run across truly moves me.  I<br>
like to think it's a function of not working in a record store anymore and<br>
only having AM in the car as much as anything else.  Then again...all this<br>
bleepy electronic shit.  Kraftwerk may envelop me in coldness, but I put on<br>
one of these computer CDs people send me, and I feel the airy embrace<br>
of...nothing.  What is this music about?  Why does it exist?  Who feels<br>
compelled to make it, record it, put it out, listen to it?  Is it still<br>
popular?  Was it ever?  I think people just buy the t-shirts.  I feel like<br>
my dad must have felt when he'd hear Minutemen and Husker Du records<br>
wafting from my bedroom.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, here are seven LPs that meant a lot to me in the last year, in the<br>
order that they occurred to me:<br>
<br>
<a href="byartist.html#goatsnake"><strong>Goatsnake, </strong><cite>I</cite> (Man's Ruin, 1999)  </a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#nastasia"><strong>Nina Nastasia, </strong><cite>Dogs</cite> (Socialist)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#shellac"><strong>Shellac, </strong><cite>1000 Hurts</cite> (Touch and Go)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#cobra"><strong>Cobra Verde, </strong><cite>Nightlife</cite> (Motel, 1999)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#phelps_black"><strong>Joel R.L. Phelps, </strong><cite>Blackbird</cite> (Pacifico, 1999)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#outkast"><strong>Outkast, </strong><cite>Stankonia</cite> (Arista)</a><br>
<a href="byartist.html#silkworm"><strong>Silkworm, </strong><cite>Lifestyle</cite> (Touch and Go)</a><br>
<br>
12 each, with extra point as the angels' share.<br>
<br>
Goatsnake is a cache of dudes from Los Angeles.  Their music has weight and<br>
impact.  The weight is moved and the impact is made with rapidity and grace<br>
and a lack of the “endearing” slop that handicaps most average rock music.<br>
Goatsnake's commitment to being a great and truly hard rock band must be<br>
admired, for it is a commitment that few are able or willing to make.  _I_<br>
crushes its would-be competition and renders laughable the tags of lazy<br>
critics ("stoner rock" chief among them).  Haven't had a chance to absorb<br>
2000's _Flower of Disease_ yet.<br>
<br>
Nina Nastasia is a winning musician from Manhattan.  Her debut is one of<br>
five discrete albums she has already written.  The marvelous, transparent<br>
arrangements on _Dogs_ are unalterably wed to the songs, and the songs<br>
themselves are so guileless and open that I want to talk back to them.<br>
Don't do that.  Why are you staying with that creep?  In addition to being<br>
a dope fiend, he isn't very nice.  Sit up straight.  Stop playing with your<br>
hair.  Everyone has to die some day.  That was a beautiful song, just the<br>
right length.  You know, you have a very nice voice.<br>
<br>
Three guys in Shellac.  Each of them is indispensable.  I have read a lot<br>
of catty reviews of _1000 Hurts_, and all of them share a reluctance to<br>
discuss the music that results when the album is put on a functioning<br>
stereo system and played through speakers.  Said music is usually brutal,<br>
occasionally touching, often real funny, and worth playing a lot.<br>
<br>
Cobra Verde are bent on returning some kind of glam whatzis to rock, as if<br>
it ever left, but aesthetic concerns don't overwhelm all the great songs on<br>
_Nightlife_, easily the band's finest record to date.<br>
<br>
On _Blackbird_, Joel R.L. Phelps puts his powerful voice on cruise control,<br>
where it has always been most effective, and the Downer Trio largely<br>
forsakes its draggy tendencies as it knocks out nine songs as good as<br>
anything JRLP has written in his long tenure in rock.  Throw in a stunning<br>
version of the Comsat Angels' "Lost Continent," and you have a flatly great<br>
album, probably the best record on which Joel has ever been.   <br>
<br>
<br>
Outkast's _Stankonia_ is a hip-hop record to be loved as well as admired.<br>
Its clear-eyed dissections of birth outta wedlock, unabashed love of "hos,"<br>
and the disenfranchisement of black America (among other things) are witty<br>
and learned, and the (actually played) music is egalitarian funk that<br>
fondly recalls Sly and the Family Stone rather than sampling them.  I like<br>
its brains, I like its ass, I like its heart, and the double vinyl is<br>
cheaper than the CD.  <br>
<br>
I'm voting for my own record because I've listened to it a hell of a lot,<br>
and I love it.  I know it's unseemly.<br>
