BEST VIDEO: <br>
Damn! I forgot to watch Much Music this year! <br>
<br>
WORST ALBUM: <br>
Christ, how can you narrow that down? I mean, how many hundreds of thousands<br>
<br>
of full-length CDs are released annually? I can list off dozens of <br>
disappointments by other wise solid artists. "Art Official Intelligence" by <br>
De La Soul springs immediately to mind. As does "Gung Ho", Patti Smith's <br>
2000 release. Not terrible albums by any stretch of the imagination, but <br>
nowhere near up to par. Oh yeah, the whole Confrontation Camp debacle (Chuck<br>
<br>
D, Professor Griff, and Kyle Ice Jason) makes it clear that Mistachuck <br>
should keep up the political punditry, but bow out of hiphop before it's too<br>
<br>
late. <br>
<br>
WORST SINGLE: <br>
Again, relative isolation from commercial radio means I lack the ability to <br>
pick Top 40 tracks outta the air. Five months after moving to the densest <br>
radio market in North America and I can't tell a Creed from a Matchbox. <br>
Colour me a cultural ‘tard. <br>
<br>
Can't Believe The Hype! (The most over-exposed and over-inflated of  2000) <br>
1. Eminem (I mean, really! I've oft wondered exactly what it'd take for me <br>
to long for the return of Vanilla Ice.) <br>
2. Elian Gonzalez. Sure, I was as charmed as the next jaded hack by Elian's <br>
heartwarming rendition of Split Enz's "Six Months In A Leaky Boat", but as <br>
the summer wound down and the news broke that Gonzales was in fact the <br>
Bacharach-wannabe self-styled pop genius with a preponderance for animal <br>
imagery who penned the Hampsterdance (sic) track and a club anthem ‘bout <br>
letting canines out, I'd had enough. The cameo in a Budweiser "Whassup!" <br>
commercial shot on location from his uncle's front porch was the final nail.<br>
<br>
<br>
Most Likely To Succeed In 2001 <br>
1. Hawksley Workman (c'mon, this fella shoulda been topping charts two years<br>
<br>
ago...what's the delay?). Andy Stochansky too, come to think of it. Picture <br>
a band featuring the two of ‘em. Now picture said band on stage at Wembley <br>
Stadium. Now picture Workman holding down Noel Gallagher whilst Stochansky <br>
applies bunsen burner-heated needlenose pliers to Oasis member's nipples. A <br>
simple thought to warm you through the long winter months ahead. <br>
<br>
2. Maximum R N B. With powerhouse promotions man Keith Maruk (Epitaph <br>
Canada) at the helm the band can't help but break large, whether or not they<br>
<br>
ever learn a chord. As an added bonus, they apparently have sev'ral chords <br>
under their belts, way more than the average rock n' roll band needs. <br>
<br>
OK now SOUND OFF! (Commentary is crucial!) <br>
Beginning in 2001, I, Russell Gragg and !Earshot Magazine will collectively <br>
launch a boycott of all musical artists with numbers in their monikers. <br>
Though we're uncertain as to whether this is simply a new band-naming trend <br>
a la the "one-syllable-word" feeding frenzy of the <br>
late-eighties/early-nineties, or whether this is, in fact, proof positive <br>
that all good band names have been taken. <br>
<br>
Either way, you've been warned FingerEleven, Sum41, Matchbox20, 3 Doors <br>
Down, Blink 182, Eve6, and don't even think about reuniting, Level 42.<br>
