    <h1><hr>Intersect</h1>

    Intersect is a game for two players, playable in about 15-20 minutes.

    <h2>Equipment</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Two stashes of 15
	<a href="http://wunderland.com/icehouse/Icehouse.html">Icehouse pyramids</a>
	(five large, five medium, and five small)
      </li>
      <li>
	Four sets of four cards numbered 1-4 (regular playing cards
	will suffice, with the aces standing in for 1).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setup</h2>

    <p>
      Sit <b>adjacent</b> to your opponent, facing at a right angle,
      rather than opposite your opponent.  Take one stash and two sets
      of cards numbered 1-4.  Deal out one set of cards 1-4 from left
      to right in front of you, so that the eight cards from you and
      your opponent label the rows and columns of a virtual 4x4 square
      grid.  The other two sets of cards will be used later.  Choose
      or determine a starting player.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Play</h2>

    <p>
      Intersect is played in two stages: the placement stage and
      the removal stage.
    </p>

    <h3>The placement stage</h3>

    <p>
      Alternate turns.  On your turn, place a pyramid of any size from
      your stash onto one of the squares in the virtual grid formed by
      the cards on the table.  There are two restrictions on
      placement:

      <ul>
	<li>
	  On your first turn, place a pyramid on any of the four
	  squares in <b>column 1</b> (the leftmost column, labeled
	  with your card numbered 1).  On your second turn, place a
	  pyramid on any of the four squares in <b>column 2</b>.
	  Continue up to column 4, then continue repeating through
	  columns 1-4.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Place each pyramid upright on an empty square or stacked on
	  top of a pyramid (belonging to either player) that is the
	  <b>same size or larger</b>.  You may never place a pyramid
	  on top of a smaller pyramid.
	</li>
      </ul>

      If you happen to have no legal placement on your turn, you must
      pass, discarding one unplaced pyramid from your stash and
      removing it from the game.  (This should be rare, with proper
      planning.)  Continue alternating turns until all pyramids have
      been placed or discarded, at which point the placement stage is
      over.
    </p>
    
    <h3>The removal stage</h3>

    <p>
      Take an unused set of cards numbered 1-4 into your hand.
      Secretly select a card from your hand and place it face down in
      front of you.  Each card corresponds to the same numbered card
      on the table in front of you, indicating one of four columns of
      the virtual grid.  When both players have selected a card,
      simultaneously reveal them.  The columns indicated by the two
      cards intersect at one square in the virtual grid; if the
      topmost pyramid in this square belongs to you, remove it and
      place it in front of you, and then discard another card from
      your hand face up.  (If the square is empty, then neither player
      discards a card.)  Both players then select another card from
      their remaining hands face down, and the game continues.  If at
      any time your hand is empty, <b>immediately</b> put all four
      cards back into your hand; in particular, if you win a pyramid
      with the last card in your hand, you must pick up all four
      cards, discard one face up, and then continue with the remaining
      three.
    </p>

    <h2>Game end</h2>

    <p>
      When you have at least three pyramids of each size in front of
      you (three large, three medium, and three small), the game is
      over and you win!
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
      I invented this game in August 2005, inspired by the
      game-choosing game described in Piers Anthony's
      <a href="http://www.piers-anthony.com/apprenticeadept.html">Apprentice Adept</a>
      series of novels.  I read these long ago, and I can't even
      remember if that game had simultaneous selection or not, but I
      remember thinking that the mechanism of each player choosing a
      row or column might make an interesting game.  I'm not
      sure I was successful, though.
    </p>

    <p>
      I submitted Intersect to the
      <a href="http://icehousegames.com/contest/icedes-5/">Fifth Ice
      Game Design Competition</a>.  The results have still not been
      posted, but since there were only 5 entries I'm guaranteed to do
      better than <a href="../aquarius/quintazone">my previous entry</a>!
