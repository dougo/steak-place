    <p>
      <a href="http://www.looneylabs.com">Looney Labs</a>
      makes a card game called
      <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Aquarius/">Aquarius</a>.
      I really like the artwork on the cards, but I find the game a little
      too random and chaotic for my tastes.  So I started trying to come up
      with alternate games that could be played with an Aquarius deck.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<p>
	  The first game I thought of, in November 2002, was inspired by
	  <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/822">Carcassonne</a>,
	  using <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/icehouse/">Icehouse</a>
	  pyramids.  It eventually evolved into
	  <a href="http://icehousegames.org/wiki/?title=Quintazone">Quintazone</a>,
          and I think it's a pretty solid game.
	</p>

      <li>
	<p>
	  In January 2003 I started kicking around the idea of a
	  trick-taking game, vaguely inspired by
	  <a href="http://www.setgame.com/xactika/">Xactika</a>
	  (which has multiple suits on each card).  I posted the idea to the
	  <a href="http://lists.looneylabs.com/mailman/listinfo/aquarius">Aquarius mailing list</a>
	  but didn't get any response.  I never actually developed this to
	  the point of being playable, but it's still rattling around in
	  the back of my mind.
	</p>

      <li>
	<p>
	  In March 2003, after showing my Carcassonne-inspired game to
	  <a href="http://www.berkshire.net/~slam/">Greg Lam</a>,
	  he came up with an idea for a racing game, also using Icehouse
	  pyramids.  I don't know if we could recreate it but I might ask
	  him one of these days.
	</p>

      <li>
	<p>
	  In November 2003, I came up with a deduction game called
	  (what else?) <a href="elementary/">Elementary</a>.  It's
	  similar to Clue, Sleuth, or especially
	  <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/756">Black Vienna</a>.
	</p>
    </ul>

    <p>
      There are several other games using the Aquarius deck listed on
      <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Aquarius/HowToPlay.html">
	the Aquarius instructions page</a>, but I haven't tried them.
      <a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Kory/Games/Pantopia/">Pantopia</a>
      looks the most promising, but I think it's still an unfinished
      design awaiting further playtesting.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have or know of any other game that use Aquarius cards,
      <a href="mailto:dougo@place.org">send me mail</a> and I'll add
      a link to it.  Actually you'd probably be better off sending a
      link to <a href="mailto:us@wunderland.com">Looney Labs</a> so it
      gets onto their Aquarius page, but if it's particularly cool I
      may single it out on this page too.
    </p>
      

    <p>
      I have invented a few <a href="../">other games</a> that don't
      use Aquarius cards.
