    <p>
      Elementary is a deduction game for 3-6 players using an
      <a href="../">Aquarius</a> deck.  Each player will need some
      scratch paper and a pencil for taking notes.
    </p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>
      Elementary uses only 20 cards from an Aquarius deck: one of each
      combination of 1, 2, or 4 elements.  In other words, pull out 5
      different single-panel cards, 10 different two-panel cards, and
      5 different four-panel cards, and put aside the rest.  (The
      easiest way to pull out the two-panel cards is to just find all
      the ones that are split the same way, horizontally or
      vertically.)  Shuffle these 20 cards together, remove one
      without looking at it and put it face-down in the center of the
      table, and then deal the rest to the players.  (Note that some
      players will be short one card, but that's okay; just make sure
      that one of the players with an extra card goes first.)
    </p>

    <h2>The Play</h2>
    <p>
      On your turn, reveal one card from your hand and place it face
      up in front of you.  Select another player; that player must
      then announce how many cards he has in his hand that have <i>at
      least one element in common</i> with the revealed card.  (It
      helps if that player also mentions how many total cards he has
      left in his hand.)  That player then takes the next turn.
    </p>

    <h2>Winning</h2>
    <p>
      At any time (even out of turn), you may announce that you know
      what the card in the center of the table is.  Write down what
      you think it is, then look at the card.  If you were correct,
      you win!  If not, place it back face-down without revealing what
      the card is, reveal all your remaining cards face-up in front of
      you, and the rest of the players continue playing.  If it was
      your turn, choose another player to go next.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>

    <p>
      I invented this game in December 2003, as part of my continuing
      project to develop <a href="../">alternate Aquarius games</a>.
      It was inspired by games like Clue, Sleuth, or especially
      <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/756">Black Vienna</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Elementary as it currently stands is playable, but I'm not very
      happy with it.  Brian Hanechak suggested a change that I think
      would help, but I still haven't tried it: when you select a
      player, that player must announce <i>the total number of
      panels</i> on cards in his hand that match panels on the
      revealed card.  If you try this out,
      <a href="mailto:dougo@place.org">mail me</a> and let me know how
      it works.
