  "As usual, lots of great releases this past year for those paying attention.   Props where they're due:  If it weren't for the internet I wouldn't even know about half of this, much less have heard it.  Parenting two young boys and working at home doesn't leave much time for record shopping or zine-reading.  By the same token, there're no doubt a ton of great records that <i>aren't</i> here -- there's still a lot I missed out on.  And that's where the rest of you come in...<p>[21-30 are honorable mentions, listed alphabetically --dougo]"
  (("Calexico"
    "Feast of Wire"
    "Quarterstick"
    "Quite simply, the best album yet from an outfit at the top of their game.  Not a clunker in the bunch.")
   ("New Pornographers"
    "Electric Version"
    "Matador"
    "Maybe not quite as strong as <i>Mass Romantic</i>, but yet another rock-solid collection of early '80s-style power pop from a bunch who know how to write a hook.  And the Dan Bejar-penned tunes can somewhat make up for a lack of new Destroyer material this past year.")
   ("The Shins"
    "Chutes Too Narrow"
    "Sub Pop"
    "Sooooo much stronger than <i>Oh, Inverted World</i>.  Gone are the muddy production and clunky drumming; instead we've got a collection of crisp, snappy pop tunes that, while all over the map stylistically, manage to gel into a coherent whole over the course of the album.  An almost perfect pop record.")
   ("The Books"
    "The Lemon of Pink"
    "Tomlab"
    "Wow, this one hit me from out of left field.  Completely unlike anything I'd heard, well, ever, The Books do a sort of folk musique concrete, taking folk guitar, banjo, etc. and cutting / sampling these snippets into lovely little songs, accompanied by obscure spoken samples and breathy vocals.   Really, really beautiful.  Maybe if Prick Decay embraced beauty instead of rusty noise they'd sound a bit like this.")
   ("The Decemberists"
    "Castaways and Cutouts"
    "Kill Rock Stars/Hush"
    "Because I always wondered what Robyn Hitchcock would sound like singing the Neutral Milk Hotel songbook.  No, really, it IS that good, and much better than the other two releases from this outfit in 2003.")
   ("The Ponys"
    "ShiShiMuMu"
    "Time-Lag"
    "Way to debut, huh?  A sprawling, double LP of psych-pop gems from this Portland, ME outfit.  The vocals are a little on the fey side, but it works for me.")
   ("Gillian Welch"
    "Soul Journey"
    "Acony"
    "Welch is one of those rare artists that can get away with releasing an album that shows absolutely zero stylistic growth.  She doesn't need to; her schtick is as old as the hills from whence it comes, and she does it exceedingly well.  On first listen, I wasn't blown away by this record, feeling it was just \"more of the same.\"  But damn if it didn't grow on me over the year to earn its place at #7.  Beverly Hills's finest offering.")
   ("No-Neck Blues Band"
    "Intonomancy / Ever Borneo (tie)"
    "s@1"
    "Yes, I do so love NNCK.  With two glorious epics to choose from this past year, I couldn't.  A tie it is.")
   ("The Dead C"
    "Damned"
    "Starlight Furniture Co."
    "Wow, still at it after, what, 17 years or something?  I missed out on the last 2 (<i>New Electric Music</i> and <i>(s/t)</i>), but this reaffirms my faith.  Yeah, it has its slow spots, but a couple of tracks on here are worth the price of admission alone.")
   ("The Rapture"
    "Echoes"
    "Strummer/Universal"
    "Yes, you <i>should</i> believe the hype.")
   ("Laura Veirs"
    "Troubled by the Fire"
    "Bella Union"
    "Unassuming indierock/country/folkie hipster chick from Seattle.  This album's greatness creeps up on you and smacks you in the back of the head.")
   ("Polyphonic Spree"
    "The Beginning Stages"
    "Hollywood"
    "I don't know much about 'em, but they seem a little cultish.  And not like in \"cult following,\" but rather like in \"creepy weirdos.\"  No matter.  Symphonic pop of the highest order.  I can't get these songs out of my head.")
   ("The Postal Service"
    "Give Up"
    "Sub Pop"
    "Oh, man.  Why do I feel dirty admitting how much I like this record?  Sugary synth pop of the PCL-era New Order magnitude, and I'll admit the guilty pleasure.  I always did love that early New Order stuff, and this album makes me feel like I'm in high school again.")
   ("Wilco"
    "Australian EP"
    "MP3 album from www.wilcoworld.net"
    "Does this count?  This 6-song EP was available as a free MP3 download to buyers of YHF on www.wilcoworld.net. As someone who's always excited about a new Wilco release, I figured I had to throw it in.  5 new songs and a fuzzed-out version of \"Camera.\"  And if including this is cheating, then let's say the Loose Fur album on Drag City should be #14.  That's real nice, too...")
   ("Cerberus Shoal"
    "Chaiming the Knoblessone"
    "North East Indie"
    "I consider this band of oddballs my hometown answer to the Sun City Girls, and given their collaboration w/ those folks it's not too far off the mark.  Weird, carnivalesque art rock that manages to be catchy while confusing.")
   ("Michael Yonkers Band"
    "Microminiature Love"
    "Sub Pop"
    "Glad to see this guy finally getting the attention he deserves.  This is the only one he recorded as \"Band,\" and is markedly more rockin' than the folkier solo stuff that followed.  Pretty close to the sound of early Red Crayola, but a bit more psych than art in this rock.")
   ("Mink Lungs"
    "I'll Take It"
    "Arena Rock Recording Co."
    "Bklyn hipster weirdo psych-pop from some crackerjack musicians. Just as strong as <i>The Better Button</i> (though, alas, nothing as good as \"Think of Me\").")
   ("Broken Social Scene"
    "You Forgot It In People"
    "Arts & Crafts/Paper Bag"
    "No, they're not the second coming of Dinosaur Jr. (or Pavement, for that matter) -- their last album was somewhat generic post-rock -- but a strong tribute to everything that was great about early '90s indie rock.  It's all so very self-consciously meta.")
   ("M. Ward"
    "Transfiguration of Vincent"
    "Merge"
    "Since I didn't hear anything new from Simon Joyner this past year, I'll have to include M. Ward's album here as my requisite dark, brooding folkie release.  Great warbly voice!  God damn I love this formula.")

As a bonus, we get the best Phil Spector wall-of-sound production \u0096 so much reverb it sounds like a roots-rock orchestra recorded in a shower stall -- that Spector never produced (or, most likely, will never get a chance to produce, at least not now). And dig it, the group\u0092s crossover success, to indierockers, jamband crusties, grey-bearded dinosaurs, was a groundswell just waiting to happen. It\u0092s the classic grassroots trickle-up theory that rarely is evidenced: indie kids catch the lo-fi vibe, followed by a bearhug from the jamband community (traditionally, the most open-minded scene in America) appreciative of the group\u0092s hard-touring, psychedelically-inclined aesthetic, and finally the old-timers and musos circling the fringes begin taking notice of some rather adept juggling of classic influences. In short, MMJ has amassed the kind of broad fanbase most groups would kill for \u0096 a people\u0092s band if there ever was one.\r\n")

It\u0092s an unnervingly powerful, cathartic final statement, too. Unsurprisingly, given how Strummer had been on a huge artistic roll with the Mescaleros, several of the tracks completed prior to his death rank among his greatest ever, from Clash-like stompers to country-gospel ballads to worldbeat-dub thumpers. Even the tracks that had to be stitched together after the fact by his bandmates display nary a ragged seam -- ragged glory, mayhaps? \u0096 including the wooliest, wooziest number they had in the can, the effects-heavy instrumental \u0093Midnight Jam.\u0094 It\u0092s a stream-of-consciousness psychedelic rocker highlighted by snippets of pure Strummerage: the \u0093vocals\u0094 are posthumously sampled deejay voiceovers from the \u0093Joe Strummer\u0092s London Calling\u0094 BBC World Service program.

    "Willie Nelson remade/remodeled by Bozulich, who brilliantly reenvisions Nelson\u0092s 1975 minimalist concept record (about a preacher who kills his wife) as an avant-garde passion play. Considering that the original album has been described as \u0093the weirdest platinum-selling country album of all time,\u0094 that\u0092s no mean feat. Leave it to maverick maiden Bozulich, alien to neither oddness (with Ethyl Meatplow) nor country (Geraldine Fibbers). Hell, while the form is still strum-and-twang on the surface, even the most country-sounding instrument here, Nels Cline\u0092s lap steel, sounds otherworldly, broadcast from a fever dream. The title track, originally a four-minute ballad, is now an 11-minute, improv-inclined waltz for droning Autoharp, eerie Celtic fiddle and rumbling, jazzy percussion. WWWD? I\u0092ll tell ya what Willie would do (and did) \u0096 he\u0092d march right in to the studio and lay down a couple of duets with Bozulich.\r\n")

Naturally the remastered/expanded edition arrives courtesy the steady hands at Rhino. The combined Tom Verlaine/Richard Lloyd assault of edgy, riff-fueled aggression and dramatic, jazz-tinged modal jamming made the CBGBs band a legend among punks, musos and hippies alike. But am I the only one who finds the angle, as pushed by certain boneheaded pundits, of TV being the \u0093punk rock Grateful Dead\u0094 faintly hilarious? One listen to the archival concert album, Live At The Old Waldorf, that Rhino concurrently issued on its Handmade subsidiary will blow that well-worn cliché right outta the water: in 1978, TV was arguably one of the most dynamic, least hippy-dippy performing outfits in the land.\r\n\r\n")
   ("Al Green"
    "I Can't Stop"
    "Blue Note"
    "Al Green is back. Reunited with his old Memphis producer Willie Mitchell, who even unearthed the original microphone Green used back in the \u009170s, he sounds like he only ducked out for a sec to make a quick call. That voice  -- the one indelibly seared into the memory of anyone who ever fell in love with soul on the radio via tracks like \u0093Let\u0092s Stay Together\u0094 or \u0093I\u0092m Still In Love With You\u0094 -- seems eternally youthful, and utterly confident, and just downright jubilant. Is this what it sounds like when a person is truly \u0093one with God\u0094? I don\u0092t know, but Rev. Green is a walking, talking, singing example of the very essence of soul-drenched spirituality.  I Can\u0092t Stop is truth-in-advertising: the wonderfully sensual title track itself finds Green pledging his love and his whole self to \u0093you,\u0094 presumably a woman, possibly to the Lord, but clearly to his muse and his music, too. \u0093Play To Win\u0094 is downright celebratory, a slice of classic fatback Southern soul, right down to the swaggering horn charts, kinetic guitar licks and sassy harmony vocals. And the album\u0092s showstopper, \u0093You,\u0094 brings together everything that\u0092s great about soul in general and Green specifically: deep passion rendered in classic songwriter metaphors (\u0093you are the sunshine of my day,\u0094 etc.) with Green in maximum \u0093yearn\u0094 mode \u0096 yes, he can still hit those knee-weakening falsetto notes, ladies \u0096 while sweeping strings lend romance to the passion and both horns and backing vocals provide the \u0093punch\u0094 \u0096 the sound of a heart that\u0092s beating faster and faster by the minute. They just don\u0092t make R&B like they used to. Dump all your children\u0092s R. Kelly CDs (and similar garbage) in the nearest landfill then hand the kids a Green greatest-hits collection along with I Can\u0092t Stop. Tell \u0091em that Al Green is about to lecture in the School of Soul, and that they\u0092ll be tested on what they learned.\r\n")

    "O, bubba, where art thou! From the same moonshine-charged band that gave the world a rock opera about Lynyrd Skynyrd -- the risk being that folks may hear the music in irony-laced quotation marks; certainly, songtitles like \u0093Your Daddy Hates Me\u0094 and \u0093Loaded Gun in the Closet\u0094 will draw  knowing winks. But peer closer: this band\u0092s as lyrically literate as Steve Earle and as full-on garage-rockin\u0092 as Jason & the Scorchers. In the song \u0093Sink Hole\u0094 you get a driving roadhouse number whose story line concerns a snooty banker who comes to foreclose on the family farm (\u0093He thinks I ain\u0092t got a lick of sense/ \u0091cause I talk slow and my money\u0092s spent,\u0094 observes the narrator) only to meet a final and -- by regional standards \u0096 just fate, stuffed in the titular crevice. It\u0092s as vivid in its depiction of Southern mores and morals as those of the Band\u0092s regional renderings some three decades prior.

On the first count,  Elefant is easily one of the year\u0092s most refreshing-sounding records: raw, but not ragged; edgy, but not indulging the po-faced faux-edginess of the Stripes\u0092 rockisback! peers (I\u0092m talkin\u0092 to you, Strokes); and just downright soulful. That\u0092s where the second count comes in. Garage rock, or whatever one cares to call the Stripes\u0092 stock-in-trade, has always implied a returning to the well for inspiration, and in turn, to craft a unique and personal expression \u0096 but not following some pre-set formula or fashion ideal.  \u0093Soul\u0094 is such an amorphous, elastic concept that it\u0092s easy to forget where it comes from: right here, inside you, nestled roughly between the brain and the heart.

    "Myth America"
    "Merchant has much to answer for, not the least of which is the cloying, uber-precious artiste image she fostered while fronting the equally crunchy 10,000 Maniacs. Somebody tell me why, a decade later, critics would decry the likes of Jewel for basically pulling the same act, yet no one ever called Merchant on it? Indeed, I used to despise the smug little twat, which, curiously, makes my newfound conversion all the more gratifying as I tuck in my napkin and settle down for a nice big plate of crow. (Roccrits should always jump at a chance to indulge revisionism, eh?) What\u0092s unfortunate is that due to certain logistics surrounding the distribution of the album \u0096 self-released by Merchant, it\u0092s being sold \u0093one-way\u0094 (no returns) to just a handful of wholesalers and retailers  \u0096 in 2003 it remained elusive to many consumers, not to mention its limited availability to the press meant that fewer reviews than usual were published. Consider this your chance to catch up, then. By ditching all major label-fueled expectations re: what her public wants, and instead dipping \u0096 nay, diving \u0096 wholly into traditional Americana, Merchant sounds a lady reborn. From swirling, Fairport Convention-styled dronefests (\u0093Sally Ann\u0094) and actual covers of the Fairports (\u0093Crazy Man Michael\u0094) to desolate, minimalist gospel-blues (\u0093Which Side Are You On?\u0094) and jubilant little banjo/fiddle struts (\u0093House Carpenter\u0094), this collection of cover material not only serves to carve out a welcome new niche for Merchant \u0096 interpreter, keeper of the flame \u0096 but allows her to regain the soul that she long ago surrendered at the altar of alterna-rock divadom. \r\n")
   ("Calexico"
    "Feast Of Wire"
    "Quarterstick"
    "Casting the music of Calexico in evocative, if sometimes imprecise, shadings has become quite the parlor game for journalists ever since the Tucson outfit surfaced in the mid \u009190s. Initially a Giant Sand offshoot duo, Calexico has since expanded both artistically (as evidenced across nine albums) and literally (a revolving cast of players sometimes finds as many as ten musicians onstage at a Calexico gig). Reviewers, however, haven\u0092t necessarily kept a similar pace. Whether smitten or flummoxed by Calexico\u0092s open-ended sound, they tend to rely on pat Southwestern imagery: \u0093border pop,\u0094 \u0093mariachi garage,\u0094 \u0093desert noir,\u0094 etc. This isn\u0092t particularly vexing for the two man Calexicans, Joey Burns and John Convertino; they are, after all, residents of the Old Pueblo and deeply enamored of the region\u0092s heritage. And granted, Feast Of Wire  does open on the very Calexicoesque, accordion-and-twang \u0093Sunken Waltz.\u0094 The gloves come off, quickly, however, with a brace of otherworldly numbers at times gothic, ambient, psychedelic and jazzy \u0096 the latter, in the Gil Evans/Charles Mingus-styled \u0093Crumble,\u0094 all blatting metro horns and decidedly un-twangy guitar. At a point in time where indie rockers across the globe seem to think that by snagging a few \u0093non-rock\u0094 instruments and recording any half-baked \u0093experimental\u0094 idea that comes into their pointy l\u0092il heads they summarily qualify as sonic adventurists, Calexico is, without doubt, the real fucking deal.\r\n")
   ("Let's Active"
    "Cypress/Afoot, Big Plans For Everybody, Every Dog Has His Day"
    "Collectors Choice"
    "Given the opportunity to reassess artistic legacies \u0096 in particular, those of defunct bands \u0096 most critics (and fans, too) will jump. This scenario becomes all the more intriguing when a congruence of events works to unexpectedly spotlight a particular musical artist on multiple fronts. That\u0092s the case right now with Let\u0092s Active. The Winston-Salem, NC, eighties pop group was recently given the tribute album treatment (Every Word, issued by Australia\u0092s Laughing Outlaw label), which led to a one-off Let\u0092s Active reunion (of sorts) at the trib\u0092s CD release party. Forthcoming is a proposed boxed set of archival material on Italy\u0092s No Tyme. And Let\u0092s Active mainman Mitch Easter is now fronting his first band over a decade and a half, The Fiendish Minstrels, with an album due in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the timing couldn\u0092t be any sweeter for the arrival of these three reissues. The two-fer pairing Let\u0092s Active\u0092s 1983 debut EP Afoot (a home demo that, after landing the trio a record deal with I.R. S. Records, was given some brushing-up and remixing) and its long-playing \u009284 followup Cypress essentially copies the out-of-print CD issued by I.R.S. in \u009289. It includes the same two bonus tracks: \u0093Grey Scale\u0094 (from the British version of the Cypress LP) and \u0093Two Yous\u0094 (from \u009282 Afoot sessions, originally appearing in 1986 on a UK 12\u0094 single). But as with Collectors\u0092 Choice\u0092s 2001 repackaging of Easter\u0092s Tarheel peers The dB\u0092s, copious liner notes, courtesy veteran scribe Scott Schinder, have been added to make the CD booklet alone worth the price of admission. Even better, the tunes themselves have aged handsomely. Easter\u0092s songwriting wasn\u0092t particularly indebted to an era or genre, making Afoot\u0092s \u0093Room With A View,\u0094 for example, a lovably odd amalgam of New Wave (dancey bass, chirpy keys), vintage Girl Group (bassist Faye Hunter\u0092s yearning lead vocal) and psychedelia. Given an actual budget for Cypress, Easter allowed his eclectic muse full reign. Improbable collisions of sitar, neoclassical keyboards, glam-slam guitars and a sprinkling of 12-string jangles turn \u0093Waters Part\u0094 into a compositional masterpiece, while the rhythmic switchbacks, fretboard flourishes and baroque mood of \u0093Lowdown\u0094 suggests a complex homage to Britain\u0092s Roy Wood and The Move. The album did have its share of sweet nougat \u0096 check the buoyant guy-gal harmonies in \u0093Easy Does\u0094 and the chunky powerpop of \u0093Blue Line\u0094 (a cover of British band The Outskirts) -- but every song had its own distinct character.\r\n\r\n1986\u0092s Big Plans For Everybody, recorded under semi-crisis conditions -- the original lineup was dissolving drummer Sara Romweber having already split -- is probably best characterized as a solo Easter effort with guests, including soon-departing Hunter plus incoming keyboardist/vocalist Angie Carlson. (Inexplicably, Collectors\u0092 Choice has omitted the auxiliary players\u0092 contributions from the credits, something that the old I.R.S. CD booklet did not do; luckily, Schinder\u0092s liner notes help keep things straight. There\u0092s also a major goof on the sleeve\u0092s tracklisting: \u0093Last Chance Town\u0094 gets erroneously retitled \u0093Last Chance To Win.\u0094) As such, Big Plans is a tougher, more complex effort, reflective of Easter\u0092s late \u009160s/early \u009170s hard rock/psych/garage roots. From the wiry, \u0093Cold Turkey\u0094-esque riffs of \u0093Last Chance Town\u0094 and the shimmery Prog informing \u0093Still Dark Out\u0094 to the backwards effect-laden psychedelia of \u0093Writing The Book Of Last Pages\u0094 and the wholly unexpected slide-guitar instrumental raveup that is \u0093Route 67,\u0094 the album serves as a sonic showcase of Easter\u0092s many musical obsessions. It also boasts, in lush, keyboard-laden opening track \u0093In Little Ways,\u0094 a drop-dead Let\u0092s Active classic every bit as memorable as Cypress\u0092 \u0093Waters Part.\u0094 Two heretofore unreleased bonus cuts from the Big Plans sessions, \u0093Horizon\u0094 (lead vocals by Hunter) and \u0093Invisible Hills,\u0094 round out the disc.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of \u0093Horizon,\u0094 by the time of 1988\u0092s Every Dog Has His Day Angie Carlson had been a full-time Active-ist for a couple of years (Eric Marshall and John Heames were the new rhythm section), and for Dog she handles lead vocals on a reworked, and utterly mesmerizing, \u0093Horizon\u0094 plus several other songs. As recorded in the UK with British producer John Leckie, the album has its charms, although Easter himself, in Schinder\u0092s liner notes, singles out a number of ill-informed moves (such as Leckie applying reverb like a house painter slaps on exterior latex, and the inclusion of the overtly arena-esque \u0093big rock\u0094 number \u0093Too Bad\u0094) that tether the album to the \u009180s era \u0096 unlike its two out-of-time predecessors. That said, songs such as the aforementioned \u0093Horizon,\u0094 the jittery \u0093I Feel Funny,\u0094 which hearkens stylistically back to the band\u0092s New Wave period, and the widescreen psych-popper of a title track all prove that Let\u0092s Active\u0092s well had in no way run dry. As with Big Plans, two unreleased tracks, alternate versions of \u0093Bad Machinery\u0094 and \u0093Sweepstakes,\u0094 have been added as bonus material. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this point, however, I.R.S. was only halfheartedly doling out the promotion, although it did release to radio  \u0093Every Dog Has His Day\u0094 as a 12\u0094 single featuring custom sleeve art boasting of celebrity fan Robert Plant\u0092s endorsement of  Let\u0092s Active during his guest VJ stint on MTV. Diminishing label interest, a crumbling personal relationship between Easter and Carlson and a changing of the musical guard as the Nirvana era loomed eventually dictated that Easter lay the group to rest. He\u0092d go on to sit out the \u009190s in order to concentrate on production duties at his Winston-Salem recording studio.\r\n\r\nIronically, the prevailing image of Southern indie-rock during the \u009180s remains one of scruffy kids wielding jangly guitars and penning Big Star/Velvet Underground-informed pop tunes. Yet Easter, one of the so-called chief architects of kudzu rock \u0096 he was co-producer of the early R.E.M. records and studio mentor to scores of regional pop combos -- turned out to be the myth-breaker. With the chance, now,  to take a fresh look at Easter\u0092s musical legacy, it\u0092s clear that Let\u0092s Active was the least jangly of \u0091em all. God bless him for that too \u0096 Mitch Easter, last of the great Southern subversives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n")
   ("Turbonegro"
    "Apocalypse Dudes "
    "Epitaph"
    "Equal parts hirsute, headbanger-stoner fuh, neo-\u009170s biker rawk and walk-on-the-wildside leatherboy punk, Sweden\u0092s Turbonegro disbanded in \u009298, just a few months before their masterpiece Apocalypse Dudes saw release (in the US, jointly issued by Sympathy and the late, great Man\u0092s Ruin). Apparently the flamboyantly unhinged vocalist Hank Von Helvete needed to take a \u0093dude, interrupted\u0094 sabbatical, although by that point the six-piece had cum, seen and conquered, leaving behind four memorable platters whose stature would grow over the next few years in the wake of celebrity testimonials from the likes of Dave Grohl, Rocket From The Crypt, Queens Of The Stone Age, Steve Albini and Jello Biafra. Last summer, Helvete having wrapped up his funny farm chores, the band got back together; a new album, Scandinavian Leather, featuring artwork by Klaus \u0093Revolver\u0094 Voorman, is due in April. Timely, given the current Scandinavian rock (Hives, Soundtrack Of Our Lives, Hellacopters, Division Of Laura Lee, International Noise Conspiracy, etc.) invasion.\r\n\r\nAss Cobra first reared its shiny head in \u009296. Given that Turbonegro\u0092s capacity for schtick-shoveling is an entire discussion in itself, I\u0092ll restrict my non-musical comments other than to note that it\u0092s kinda hard to overlook the album\u0092s Tom Of Finland-meets-Pet Sounds sleeve art, singer Helvete\u0092s nekkid-with-python center photo spread and songtitles such as \u0093I Got Erection,\u0094 \u0093Sailor Man\u0094 and that tender ode to forbidden love, \u0093The Midnight NAMBLA.\u0094 In a nutshell, then, the band\u0092s punk-hardcore roots are rigidly on display here: the powercharged \u0093Denim Demon\u0094 not only sounds like a speeded-up Ramones romp, it quotes from Patti Smith\u0092s \u0093Rock \u0091n\u0092 Roll Nigger\u0094; \u0093A Dazzling Display Of Talent\u0094 could pass for an outtake from Australian thug-punkers The Cosmic Psychos; and the feral vocal growl and \u0093my generation sucks\u0094 sentiments of \u0093Hobbit Motherfuckers\u0094 makes you long for the glory days of Black Flag. Throw in a stiff dose or two of venereal rocker G.G. Allin and you just about got it.\r\n\r\nBut Apocalypse Dudes is where the pedal hits the metal, a jackbooted blast from the near-past that references all of the above and more. (Including the Village People, judging from the band photos which, aside from Helvete\u0092s inexplicably swapping his mustachio\u0092d cabana-boy image for a more lurid King Diamond look, are a study in sailor, cowboy and construction \u0096 not too many Indians in Sweden, one s\u0092poses \u0096 chic). Every song\u0092s a swaggering winner, from the fiery \u0093Search And Destroy\u0094 knockoff \u0093Self Destructo Bust\u0094 and the Ramones (\u0093I Just Want To Have Something To Do\u0094)-meets-Alice Cooper (\u0093I\u0092m Eighteen\u0094) thrasher \u0093Get It On,\u0094 to the brutally efficient, Blue Oyster Cult-styled anthemism of \u0093Rock Against Ass\u0094 and the rump-riding Judas Priest/Quiet Riot stylings of \u0093Rendezvous With Anus.\u0094 And while I\u0092m somewhat loathe to parse too many lines \u0096 what can be said, after all, about a passage like \u0093Fornicator of the lasso/ Sperminator of the asshole/ Prince of the rodeo\u0094? \u0096 there\u0092s still something refreshingly Spinal Tap-ish going on that no lover of rock arcana can resist. Consider: over-the-top, neo-orchestral album opener \u0093The Age Of Pamparius,\u0094 with its \u0093Back In Black\u0094 riffage and \u0093whoah-woah-ohh!\u0094 massed chanting, sounds like the kind of fist-pumping arena crud that fueled many a teen rebel anthem back in the day. By \u009299, however, complaining about being stuck behind the counter at a fast-food joint was what passed for rebellion, as Turbonegro\u0092s incisive lyric study suggests: \u0093So you think you had a pepperoni/ So you think you had a calzone/ So you thought you could make your own/ So you thought you could take it home/ Apocalypse dudes got nothing to lose/ Gonna bake a motherfucking pizza tonight!\u0094 Amen.

   ("Gov't Mule"
    "The Deepest End: Live In Concert "
    "ATO"
    "Just over a year ago I sat down to interview Warren Haynes, vocalist and fretboard wizard for the mighty Gov\u0092t Mule. We talked about his band\u0092s then-latest releases, The Deep End Vols. 1 & 2, which saw Haynes, keyboardist Danny Louis and drummer Matt Abts squaring off with a legion of internationally-known bassists (everyone from John Entwistle, Jack Bruce and Phil Lesh to Metallica\u0092s Jason Newsted, Phish\u0092s Mike Gordon and Widespread Panic\u0092s Dave Schools). Underlying the urge to collaborate and jam with gifted players, suggested Haynes, was a burning need to keep pushing the envelope, to challenge oneself, to get as far out there on the edge \u0096 and beyond -- as possible.\r\n\r\nCertainly no more compelling evidence of that artistic drive exists at the moment than The Deepest End, recorded last May at New Orleans\u0092 storied Saenger Theatre. True to its two studio predecessors, a who\u0092s-who of low-end theorists turned up, among them Newsted, Schools, Gordon, Jack Casady, Roger Glover, Les Claypool and the Meters\u0092 George Porter, Jr. Others with walk-ons at the marathon show included Bela Fleck, slide virtuoso Sonny Landreth, and funk legends Fred Wesley and Bernie Worrell. (Bonus points to the Mule\u0092s Abts, who performs above and beyond the call of duty by handling kit chores for the duration. He is, verily, a man of iron.) Yet while raw stats are impressive enough \u0096 5 ½ hours, 36 songs, 13 bassists and 25 total guests \u0096 the combined sonic and visual impact of this 2-CD, 1-DVD package is nigh-on impossible to convey on paper. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow, then, can I count the ways? Hmm\u0085 (1) A sinewy, swinging, jazzy \u0093John The Revelator\u0094 featuring Haynes uncorking edgy slide riffs over the honks, blats and squalls of the Dirty Dozen Brass Band Horns. (2) The luminous, soulful and otherworldly Haynes original Beautifully Broken\u0094 (w/Porter on bass) that interpolates portions of Prince\u0092s \u0093When Doves Cry.\u0094 (3) A visceral take of Allen Toussaint\u0092s New Orleans classic \u0093On Your Way Down\u0094 with bottleneck marksmen Haynes and Landreth dueling to the death. (4) An astonishing 14-minute \u0093Voodoo Chile\u0094 wherein Casady reprises his original Electric Ladyland role and Haynes bays at the moon like a junkyard dog. \r\n\r\nAnd that\u0092s just four out of 36. Intriguingly, the combined CD-DVD package is set up so that you get 2 ½ hours of audio and about 3 ½ hours of video. Ergo, some songs are exclusive to either the CDs or the DVD, while certain tracks appear in both formats. Sound quality, of course, is beyond reproach, and the camerawork on the DVD is uniformly outstanding. (Funny, too \u0096  as credits roll at the end of the DVD, mini-testimonials begin appearing onscreen, Haynes alternately getting toasted and roasted by his guests. Clearly a man who has earned the admiration of peers and legends alike.) In fact, this just may qualify as one of the most riveting live artifacts I\u0092ve encountered in years \u0096 certainly the best live release of 2003.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne particular DVD extra bears noting, a documentary video about the concert featuring rehearsal footage and interview clips. Echoing what Haynes said to me during our interview last year, various players comment about the inextricably twinned thrill/fear of improvisation. Dave Schools in particular cites the allure \u0093of going to places that are unsafe\u0085 to get out there,\u0094 and that\u0092s precisely the vibe one gets taking in The Deepest End \u0096 musicians in full flight, without a net.\r\n\r\n\r\n")

    "Anybody riled up and/or made misty-eyed by the recent R.E.M. tour in which the boys from Athens pulled out all sorts of oldies -- this (silver) disc's for you. A vintage German TV broadcast \u0096 recorded in Bochum 10/2/85 --  from the \"Rockpalast\" program, source of many a coveted converted-from-P.A.L.-format VHS tape over the years -- this captures 'em at an early peak, circa the Fables Of The Reconstruction album. There's Michael Stipe, bleached blond hair (and newly-shorn locks) and black eyeliner, alternately solemn and sarcastic at the mic; Mike Mills and Pete Buck, still in their bouncing ping-pong balls mode; and Bill Berry, mono-browed and assured at his kit. Ah, the memories... With a setlist well-stuffed with R.E.M. classics and even more classic covers (of Television, the Stones, Aerosmith, Creedence, even Roger Miller) and so many classic MOMENTS (such as Stipe pledging allegiance to the flag to intro \"Little America\"), how can you pass this up? I saw R.E.M. many times during this period and can personally testify that the TV broadcast absolutely does justice to their natural charisma, their offhand sense humor and their undeniable rock 'n' roll prowess. It's a great transfer too, with only very slight graininess detectable to indicate it's not taken directly from the broadcast itself. A notation at the end reads \"Rockpalast Classics\" -- possibly this was a subsequent rebroadcast that netted a high-quality recording somewhere in the loop. The packaging is outstanding, too. The DVD itself is a picture disc, and housed in the clear plastic clamshell is a full-color 2-sided insert with stills from the broadcast.\r\n")
   ("Bob Dylan"
    "Eat The Document DVD"
    "Watchdog"
    "Back history: this was a D.A. Pennebaker-filmed, Dylan/Howard Alk-edited documentary of the legendary \u009266 Dylan/Band tour of Europe, and while ABC-TV had commissioned the project, the network deemed it \u0093too vulgar\u0094 for TV and rejected it outright. (Gee, could it have been due to Scene 55\u0092s extended segment of a jabbering stoned/drunk Dylan and John Lennon?) Since then, it has surfaced on a limited official basis at film festivals and such but has never appeared in any genuine commercial or retail form. As a result, grainy/flawed bootleg versions have been what the public has had to put up with. Until now. UK boot label Watchdog landed a clean 16mm print and mastered it to DVD, yielding an outstanding video transfer and, for the most part \u0096 given the 16mm source -- a solid audio transfer too. And not only is there a fantastic 24-page booklet that takes you through the 54-minute film scene-by-scene that comes with the package, 20 minutes of DVD extras are included on the disc: \u0093Ballad of a Thin Man\u0094 (outtake), Bob Dylan and John Lennon In a Car (outtake), and Bob Arrives in Sweden (B&W newsreel footage). Insanely fascinating stuff. Hunt it while you can \u0096 only a thousand copies were made. Verily, one of rock\u0092s most holiest of grails.\r\n\r\n")

    "Tales From The Australian Underground: Singles 1976-89 "
    "Peel Presents, AUS"
    "Long before Kurt Cobain\u0092s junk-corroded, splattered brains came to define rock \u0091n\u0092 roll\u0092s unruly, primitive spirit, bands such as Radio Birdman, Died Pretty, Cosmic Psychos, The Birthday Party, etc. were doing the troglodyte stomp with booze-fueled finesse. If you picked up the 2002 Oz collection Do The Pop!  and dug that, you\u0092ll dig this too. Fun fact: Included are The Scientists, a huge influence on St. Cobain\u0092s Mudhoney pals. \r\n")
   ("Windbreakers"
    "Time Machine (Greatest Hits \u009282-\u009202) "
    "Paisley Pop"
    "Once upon a time, way down in kudzu land there dwelled Mississippi\u0092s Windbreakers, whose gifted songwriting axis Tim Lee and Bobby Sutliff helped spearhead, along with regional kindred spirits R.E.M., Let\u0092s Active and The dB\u0092s, the \u009180s powerpop charge (key artifact: 1985\u0092s Terminal, on Homestead Records). Since the band\u0092s dissolution a decade ago, Lee and Sutliff have surfaced (and even reunited) on occasion -- both also issued solo albums this year \u0096 including selected dates to plug this long overdue retrospective. First off, you get a pair of new tunes produced by longtime collaborator Mitch Easter (Let\u0092s Active): Sutliff\u0092s wistful, harmony-rich title composition, and the shimmery 12-string jangler \u0093Basket Case\u0094 (penned by popster Neilson Hubbard).18 archival nuggets follow, reaching as far back as 1983\u0092s Any Monkey With A Typewriter EP. The compilation wisely lingers on the Terminal LP via six of the band\u0092s most out-of-time cuts, including the dark, surf-tinged psychedelia of \u0093Changeless\u0094 and a garagey cover of Television\u0092s \u0093Glory\u0094 which features Lee and Sutliff backed up by L.A.\u0092s paisley-psych combo The Rain Parade. Those are followed by few tracks apiece from the subsequent three albums (1986\u0092s Run, 1989\u0092s At Home With Bobby & Time, 1991\u0092s Electric Landlady). The cumulative effect of all this uncommonly sophisticated, well-crafted pop-rock is less akin to a nostalgia fest than a call to arms for aficionados of the genre: Somebody reissue the entire Windbreakers\u0092 back catalog pronto!\r\n")
   ("No River City"
    "This Is Our North Dakota"
    "Six Little Shoes"
    "When this Atlanta duo debuted earlier this year with the \u0093Burn Down Our Own Home\u0094 single, yours truly was instantly smitten, comparing NRC\u0092s strummy, harmony-strewn sound to that of Alejandro Escovedo and Whiskeytown. The 45 was scant preparation, however, for the impact the new full-length bow wields. Let\u0092s face it, folks can namedrop as many alt-country pioneers and icons they wish \u0096 in NRC\u0092s case, Gram & Emmylou, Jayhawks, Richard Buckner, Ryan Adams and Escovedo clearly loom large as influences \u0096 but at the end of the day, it really boils down to, does the musical act have memorable tunes, and does it bring something unique to the table? Here, on both counts, the answer is an unequivocal \u0091yes.\u0092 The lovely original \u0093Fainter On My Tongue,\u0094 for example, finds Drew de Man, against a backdrop burnished guitars and co-vocalist Terri Kay Onstad\u0092s lush cello lines, ruminating on a relationship that grew violent (\u0093you kissed me with a left hook/ leave me standing like a scarecrow\u0094) and went south. The tone of rueful regret in de Man\u0092s voice is so convincing you can\u0092t help but wonder if the tune\u0092s painful to perform night after night. It\u0092s a dark album, in fact (the title is instructive), made darker still by a cover of U2\u0092s harrowing junkie portrait \u0093Running To Stand Still.\u0094 It\u0092s deceptively upbeat and twangy, with a buoyant de Man/Onstad vocal duet in the foreground and a sweet accordion figure running throughout. Yet the shock of recognition -- at unexpectedly hearing a tune from the past so expertly overhauled as to suggest it was originally written with such a country-rock arrangement in mind \u0096 is what  lends \u0093RTSS\u0094 its power. In this instance, the cover bests the original. Like the telltale taste of a shot of dope on the back of your tongue just before the body rush hits, the song is delicious, erotically charged and absolutely terrifying.\r\n")
   ("The Meters"
    "Fiyo At The Fillmore Vol. 1"
    "Too Funky/Fuel 2000"
    "As we all know, the Meters story didn\u0092t end in 1977. The group got back together in 1990 and has since rode a crest of revived popularity not dissimilar to that enjoyed by George Clinton with his P-Funk All Stars. David Russell Batiste, Jr. replaced drummer Modeliste, and after fretboard virtuoso Brian Stoltz subsequently took over for Nocentelli the Meters changed their name to The Funky Meters even as a whole new generation of tie-dyed, jamband-centric kids was discovering the pleasures of the groove. That\u0092s where Fiyo At The Fillmore Volume 1 comes in. Taped in March of 2001 at San Fran\u0092s venerable Fillmore Auditorium, this outstanding concert disc takes some good ole funky music directly to the streets, serving up key Meters classics such as \u0093People Say,\u0094 \u0093Cissy Strut\u0094 and \u0093Fire On The Bayou,\u0094 each one now topping the ten-minute mark to allow for maximum rump-wiggling time. The latter swamp-funk gem has over the years become a classic band-audience singalong  and here one readily imagines the entire Fillmore knee-deep in the aforementioned groove as Stoltz unleashes peals of Hendrix-like licks, Neville answers with supple keyboard runs of his own and Batiste and Porter undulating with a proverbial tight-but-loose precision.  If ever there was a monicker that fit a group perfectly \u0096 ladies and gents, meet the Funky Meters.\r\n"))

And 2003 struck me as a year in which, given the one-song-at-a-time imperative as forged by the aforementioned download generation, singles stood a chance once again to matter. Not \u0093matter\u0094 as in, what dipshit rapper is featured as a guest or what lame remix appears as a B-side, but as in, actually having some sort of meaningful content. There\u0092s the paradox: singles are supposed to be fun, frivolous, temporary and throwaway, right? To those of us with long memories, not necessarily. I can still recall the music of revolution and transformation being the occasional domain of mainstream radio back in the late \u009160s; back then, the thrill of hearing, say, the Doors\u0092 \u0093Break On Through,\u0094 or Jefferson Airplane\u0092s \u0093Volunteers,\u0094 or Hendrix\u0092 version of \u0093All Along The Watchtower,\u0094 or CSN\u0092s \u0093Wooden Ships\u0094 or even the Beatles\u0092 \u0093Revolution\u0094 come over the car radio was nearly as visceral as seeing the nightly images on TV of protesting students and soldiers in Vietnam.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u0092m deluding myself, of course; the short attention span syndrome among America\u0092s youth (as triggered by prolonged exposure to GameBoy and X-box radiation) ensures a blithe, blissful existence, unencumbered by controversy or dissonance, for most. But hey, this is my world, not theirs, I\u0092m writing about, so for me, 2003-by-singles meant pondering some notions, in varying degrees of specificity, of personal and cultural metaphysics: Joe Strummer\u0092s cover of Marley\u0092s \u0093Redemption Song,\u0094 issued as both a promo single and a 45 in the UK; the Mavericks\u0092 \u0093I Want To Know,\u0094 drawn from an otherwise tepid album full soft-rock noodling only a Josh \u00931972\u0094 Rouse fan could love; Steve Winwood\u0092s surprisingly soulful, grooveworthy \u0093Why Can\u0092t We Live Together,\u0094 a cover of the old Timmy Thomas TK Recs hit; and of course Johnny Cash\u0092s astounding take on Trent Reznor\u0092s \u0093Hurt,\u0094 made all the more vivid thanks to the accompanying video.<p> \r\n\r\n\r\nAs this was the year I found myself overwhelmingly repoliticized \u0096 I was neatly primed last year by Steve Earle\u0092s \u0093John Walker Blues\u0094 and the entire Jerusalem album, so much so that I even found myself writing a few letters to the editor in \u009203! -- I was also irresistibly drawn to the outright political commentary found wafting about in the ether. Hey let\u0092s face it: SOMEBODY has to stand up and offer an alternative to the redneck, jingoistic likes of Toby \u0093Shock \u0091n Y\u0092all\u0094 Keith. If Fleetwood Mac\u0092s \u0093Peacekeeper\u0094 was too subtle for the mainstream to grasp its real message (subtle enough to prevent the group getting Dixie Chicked, eh?) there were some fairly in-your-face statements available for the listening, from Black Eye Peas\u0092 anti-CIA lyrics in \u0093Where Is The Love\u0094 to R.E.M.\u0092s anti-war anthem \u0093The Final Straw\u0094 (sadly, not included on the group\u0092s Best Of collection and only available at www.remhq.com as a free MP3 download) to Ed Sanders\u0092 needs-no-qualifying \u0093Impeach George Bush.\u0094 The latter, one should note, was also a MP3. It could and still can be found, along with a host of other left-leaning, wholly righteous tunes, at www.protest-records.com, a free download site mounted by Sonic Youth\u0092s Thurston Moore (who himself uploaded a track he and Mike Watt recorded, \u0093Fourth Of July\u0094). If there was ever the voice of the people being distilled and concentrated into one neat little corner of the Internet, Protest-Records is it.<p>\r\n\r\nThis leaves the Outkast tune, \u0093Hey Ya.\u0094 I guess one day we\u0092ll need a party theme song for when Bush is kicked out of office, and this will do just fine. A million (squared) downloaders can\u0092t be wrong, now, can they?<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nHonorable mention: Karl Denson\u0092s Tiny Universe Check Out Your Mind (Relaxed), which technically came from the Aug. \u009202 album The Bridge but was subsequently picked up by numerous public radio and adult contemporary format stations thanks to its sleek groove and timely message \u0096 courtesy the song\u0092s author, one Curtis Mayfield.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nWORST ALBUMS<p>\r\n\r\nThe Strokes Room On Fire (RCA)\r\nDoes anyone honestly care about Peaches? About, I mean, her alleged \u0093potty-mouth\u0094 and the critics who cite same in reviews? Can we add \u0093potty-mouth\u0094 to the list of banned words for \u009204? And take Ryan Adams \u0096 please. Really, who gives a fuck whether he used to be the alt-country scene\u0092s preeminent wylde chylde but is now a \u0093postmodern classicist\u0094 (or some such crit-blather) dipping his talented tippy-toes into retro waters? Does anyone smell VH1 Classic in the kid\u0092s future? But I digress. The worst album of the year: The Strokes Room On Fire.  Jeez, it seems, like\u0085 soooo yesterday.  Now don\u0092t get me wrong; I loved the \u009201 debut. But someone \u0096 it won\u0092t be Spin -- needs to say it: the emperor has no clothes, and this album has no goddam tunes. In lieu of actual verses, choruses, bridges, codas, etc. you get a skeletal collection of half-assed riffs, sloppy bass lines, monotonous beats (please shoot the rhythm section) and screechy, overly compressed vox. Not to mention the most one-dimensional, dynamics-free production this side of an old cereal box record. Incredibly enough, an album that retroactively justifies all the preemptive/preliminary backlash that the haters were heard dispensing last year.<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nLucinda Williams World Without Tears (Lost Highway). More like Letdown Without Warning \u0096 dang, what happened Luce (and what\u0092s up with that faux-rap thing you\u0092re doing? ). This is a sloppy, hastily-conceived affair. Sheesh. I think I\u0092ll just copy my year-end comments for 2001\u0092s Essence \u0096 which was my fave album of that year \u0096 and if you simply change all positive sentiments to negative and you\u0092ve got my thoughts on WWT.  On Essence: \u0093For a quote/unquote \u0093alt-country rec,\u0094 this is about as uncliched as they come, an intimate, oftentimes fearless portrayal of emotional stasis and how it can bring one\u0092s life to a shuddering halt. It\u0092s also erotic as hell \u0096 \u0093C\u0092mon baby, let me taste your stuff,\u0094 Williams purrs, as if she were a phone-sex operator dialing in from somewhere down on Main Street. And sonically, it\u0092s got an uncommon potency and heft that artists, it must be said, rarely chance upon twice.\u0094 With WWT, that latter prediction comes true.<p>\r\n\r\nArab Strap Monday At The Hug And Pint (Matador)\r\nIt\u0092s telling enough the working title for Arab Strap\u0092s fifth studio album was The Cunted Circus. For not even the more cuddlesome one head Strappers Aiden Moffat and Malcolm Middleton settled upon will land \u0091em a \u0093G\u0094 rating; these tunes about pathological losers, drunkards, brigands and sluts are cast, titular-wise, along lines of \u0093Act Of War,\u0094 \u0093Flirt\u0094 and \u0093Fucking Little Bastards.\u0094 What, you expected a Barney singalong from a band named after a marital aid? Business as usual, then, for a group that never met a personal relationship it couldn\u0092t twist into a vicious anecdote or a seedy memoir. Musically speaking, Arab Strap\u0092s bleak brand of post-folk gets a facelift here and there, primarily through the full-time introduction of violin and cello, bringing to the surface what an oftentimes subliminal orchestral vibe. Ultimately, though, the listener\u0092s attention is prone to wandering over the course of this 46-minute trip down the pub. Following a strong opening gambit (the disco-flavored \u0093The Shy Retirer\u0094) it\u0092s a full four more songs before the band hits another peak, with the polyrhythmic, dreamy \u0093Flirt\u0094 \u0096 which, significantly or not, features musical contributions, as does \u0093Act Of War,\u0094 from outsiders (Bright Eyes\u0092 Conor Oberst and Mike Mogis). Perhaps an EP was more in order; after imbibing the brilliantly besotted soul of 2001\u0092s The Red Thread, this is like sipping nonalcoholic beer.<p> \r\n\r\nBon Jovi This Left Feels Right (Island)\r\nThis may seem like a sittting duck but I have a confession: I\u0092ve always liked Bon Jovi. But no, this left does not feel right. This left feels like veering wildly and driving straight off a cliff into a flooded ravine some 100 feet below. It\u0092s the sound of men who are dangerously pussywhipped -- by Heather Locklear, Calista Flockhart, who knows? \u0096 and have been taking some bad medicine, er, advice. Granted, MTV\u0092s Unplugged made it acceptable for dyed-in-the-wool rockers to get in touch with their sensitive sides (to this day I think the best \u0093Unplugged\u0094 episodes were not the ones by 10,000 Maniacs or Eric Clapton, but the Great White and Alice In Chains segments), and nowadays it\u0092s commonplace for a group to tinker with its back catalogue. Remake/remodel or rehash/recycle? Only a true fan\u0092s inner logic can say.<p>\r\n\r\nMoi, well, one of life\u0092s guiltiest of pop pleasures has always been Bon Jovi\u0092s \u0093Livin\u0092 On A Prayer.\u0094 With its pulse-quickening dynamics and deftly-wrung melody it\u0092s a memorable slice of Jersey shore blue-collar rock that pushes the same musical and emotional buttons as many of Springsteen\u0092s you-and-me-babe-against-the-odds anthems. The singer\u0092s subtle but very real sigh of resignation that comes at the end of the lines, \u0093Gina dreams of running away/ When she cries in the night/ Tommy whispers, baby it\u0092s okay \u0096 someday\u0094, is, perversely, one of rock\u0092s great dramatic highs, conveying more in a single breath than most artists come up with in entire careers.<p>\r\n\r\nPrayers can\u0092t help Tommy and Gina now, however, terminally potbellied and saggy-boobed and with their once-timeless teenage anthem cruelly turned into a soggy bowl of MOR duet mush courtesy Jon Bon J and actress Olivia d\u0092Abo, the teen-poon princess who once played Fred Savage\u0092s hippie sister in The Wonder Years (but, like Gina, now lives a life of diminishing returns \u0096 Tarzan And Jane, anyone?). This new version, with its muted acoustic strums, crystalline keyboard flurries and cardboard percussion, twinkles and wheezes with all the pizzazz of a New Age flute concerto. And while I\u0092m mildly fascinated by an admittedly adventurous reworking of the vocal melody, d\u0092Abo\u0092s side of the duet is so emotionally uninvolved \u0096 did she stash some \u0091ludes scored from some dealer during those wonder years? -- as to deaden whatever lingering impact the song had. It\u0092s hokier than a love note left on Linda Evans\u0092 pillow by Yanni when\u0092s gone off to headline the Acropolis.<p>\r\n\r\nWhat were they thinking? I won\u0092t even get into the band\u0092s choice of producer, Patrick Leonard, the brains behind Rod Stewart\u0092s and Bryan Adams\u0092 Unplugged albums. No, there are far greater crimes being committed here, from the sampling and ersatz electronica that dots \u0093Wanted Dead Or Alive\u0094 and the Elton John-with-strings arrangement of \u0093It\u0092s My Life\u0094 to the Sheryl Crow-by-way-of-Bryan Adams (aha!) M.O.R. take on \u0093Bad Medicine\u0094 and the bluesy, slide-guit strut that is the new/improved \u0093You Give Love A Bad Name.\u0094 The latter, unfortunately, fails to do for Bon Jovi what an overhauled \u0093Layla\u0094 did for Eric Clapton on his Unplugged album, namely, bring out previously-veiled nuances of an already classic tune while lending new emotional heft.<p>\r\n\r\nMake no mistake, Bon Jovi is one of those bands that I\u0092ve always respected, much to the chagrin of my fellow hacks. That said, in the liner notes guitarist Richie Sambora unintentionally fed me this review\u0092s punchline when he remarked, \u0093I don\u0092t ever recall a band doing this.\u0094 Well no, Richie, I don\u0092t recall  a band deliberately setting out to deep-six its artistic credibility either \u0096 Lou Reed doing Metal Machine Music doesn\u0092t count \u0096 but hey, more power to ya. Even folks who attempt but fail at suicide eventually maintain simply by living on a prayer or two.<p>\r\n\r\nBUMMER OF THE YEAR \u0096 ELLIOTT SMITH:\r\nOn the night of Tuesday, October 21, I got home from my shitty burger-flipping job, fixed up a nice big shot of dope, and then promptly passed out for about 12 hours. When I awoke the next morning word of rocker Elliott Smith\u0092s suicide was all over the news (well, the music news venues \u0096 it was hardly a mainstream-worthy item). And I felt very, very bad\u0085. Okay, the first part I just wrote isn\u0092t true; I neither have a day job nor shoot dope. I\u0092ve just always wanted to write something as pathetic as what a certain rock hack wrote roughly a decade ago in his self-serving Kurt Cobain eulogy. But I did feel bad when I got the news on Smith. I felt bad for his girlfriend (who found the body) and his associates (who no doubt had to clean up the bloody mess). I felt bad for all the fans who truly loved the man\u0092s music, too; admittedly, Smith was not a major talent, but as with most overtly sensitive, nakedly autobiographical, occasionally hitting-the-mark singer-songwriters, he had a certain charisma that a lot of folks gravitated towards. And I felt bad for the many misguided kids who, like those waifs \u0091n\u0092 wastrels that earlier deified Cobain, will view Smith\u0092s suicide through romantic, Hemingway-tinted glasses. If indeed this was a suicide; as I write some news reports have surfaced to cast possible doubt on that determination; details at 11. If it wasn\u0092t suicide, as they used to say on Saturday Night Live, never mind \u0096 although it won\u0092t change my opinion of suicide in general. Because as with most suicides, Smith\u0092s act was the ultimate in narcissism and selfishness. May Smith, who betrayed the faith all his friends, family and fans had invested in him, rot in hell along with fellow junkie Cobain. They both surrendered their claims to heaven, of course, along with their claim to being worthy of our pity or veneration.<p>\r\n\r\nUPPER OF THE YEAR:\r\nEvery parent has some oh-so-precious anecdote about their kid and music-hound parents are the worst. (\u0093Do you know, at 6 months he was shaking his rattle in time with my favorite Ramones song\u0085). I\u0092m no different. A few nights before Christmas we were keeping warm around the fire and listening to a live radio broadcast of the Stained Souls (a Georgia supergroup of sorts featuring Col. Bruce Hampton, Tinsley Ellis, members of Widespread Panic and others). As they were shifting Willie Dixon\u0092s classic \u0093Spoonful\u0094 into serious high-choogle gear, I looked over and noticed that my 2-year old had sprung up and was half-jogging, half-dancing around the coffee table. Not particularly elegantly, mind you, more Joe Cocker than Fred Astaire. But without any trace of self-consciousness, oblivious to everything but the music and his private sense of cadence. I imagined myself as a kid, wondered what particular song or record kick-started my own musical journey upriver into the heart of the rock \u0091n\u0092 roll groove. Peering again at my son and looking at the beatific smile on his face, all I could think was, what a great Christmas gift. This year, young Eli received a guitar from Santa \u0096 hey, even an old guy like me can still dream, right?<p>\r\n\r\nHERO OF THE YEAR:\r\nU.S. Court Of Appeals (District Of Columbia) \u0096 for overturning, in December, a lower court's decision allowing the RIAA to file subpoenas against ISPs in order to force them to hand over names of alleged copyright violators (i.e., downloading pirates) The RIAA's argument, suggested the court, that the subpoenas allowed in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act would also apply to content stored with or transmitted via an ISP \u0093borders upon the silly\u0094.<p>\r\n\r\nVILLAIN OF THE YEAR (1):\r\nThe RIAA (duh).<p>\r\n\r\nVILLAIN OF THE YEAR (2):\r\nBest Buy. I just never learn, do I? I didn\u0092t have a villain category last year but of course anyone who read my comments knows my feelings on Best Buy. When I lived in Arizona I was used to instant access to new music (I worked in a record store)  but the record shopping is a little more complicated here in Asheville so I have to hit all the stores. Every time \u0096 I mean, every single time -- I try to find something that\u0092s not, say, in the top 50 of the Billboard charts at Best Buy, my desire is thwarted. The stock selection is lousy and the staffers seem to have been hired directly from a deficient, GameBoy-scarred gene pool. I\u0092m lured, of course, by the loss-leadering ads in the Sunday morning paper. Still.. to paraphrase those famous MasterCard commercials\u0085 Total savings while shopping at Best Buy: maybe a couple of bucks. Cost of gasoline, time and general angst in dealing with the clowns who stock the Best Buy bins: a whole fucking lot. Sticking with costlier but more reliable independent retailers in town and on the Web:  priceless.<p>\r\n \r\nROCK CRITIC OF THE YEAR (1):\r\n\r\nLiz Phair, for her June 29 letter to the New York Times. Written as a parable and adapting the old \u0093Chicken Little\u0094 tale, she attempted to answer all the haters who were claiming she\u0092d sold out (true) and/or that her latest album sucked (even truer). Sample excerpt: \u0093\u0085as Chicken Little was poring over some back issues of other writers' material, she felt another idea about to form in her mind. ''Truth . . . no . . . Lies \u0085 no . . . ummm . . . ummm . . . Conspiracy!'' She was just about to write this down, when a great clattering and scraping began above her head. Clutching her PC to her \r\nbreast, she swung her head wildly to and fro. ''The sky is falling! This time, the sky is falling! The sky is falling!''<p>\r\n\r\nROCK CRITIC OF THE YEAR (2):\r\n\r\nGina Arnold, for simultaneously biting the roccrit community hand that feeds her and writing about Liz Phair\u0092s preposterously tacky new album in the July 16 issue of the East Bay Express. Arnold \u0096 who I\u0092ve been a fan of in the past, make no mistake -- was heard straightfacedly comparing Liz to Elvis. The resulting gale force of laughter was felt from the bejeweled gates of Graceland to the gleaming girders of the Golden Gate Bridge \u0096 and across all the Internet crit-newsgroups in between. Sample excerpt: \u0093Liz Phair has presented the world with a conundrum: a commercial record by an edgy artist. As such, it has created the greatest example of raging idiocy in rock criticism since the mainstream press decried Elvis Presley for wiggling his hips.\u0094<p>\r\n\r\nINTO THE AETHER:\r\nLike most people, I\u0092d anticipated Johnny Cash\u0092s passing for a long time. It was when June Carter Cash died unexpectedly - the media accounts alone had been heartbreaking enough, husband Johnny at her bedside in the hospital, sending out a request to everyone to please pray for her recovery -- that I found myself pondering life and death, however. While my mother was still alive she was fond of saying, \u0093You know you\u0092re getting old when you dress to go to a funeral at least once a week.\u0094 And while many of us are terrified of confronting mortality, Mom didn\u0092t seem to dread funerals. Having laid to rest both parents, a brother and her husband, she\u0092d somehow learned, over the years, to navigate the emotionally un-navigable with the grace and reserve expected of a Southern woman. Would I ever accept death in such matter-of-fact terms? Intellectually, I wanted to think yes. But I just couldn\u0092t shake the mental image of Johnny sitting in his Tennessee home, alone in the dark, grieving for June, maybe asking himself some of the same questions we were asking. He was the hard-living one, right? The one with the recent health problems? The impossibly frail-looking man in that video of his cover of Nine Inch Nails\u0092 \u0093Hurt\u0094? The one who was supposed to go first? And I thought of my mother, upstairs in her room, alone with her TV shows, in the weeks after my father died. Did she ask any questions? Did she get any answers? Is that why she came to accept death with such grace and reserve?<p>\r\n\r\n\r\nBYE-BYE, JOHNNY:\r\nI met Johnny Cash once, in 1990, at a wrap party for the Tom Cruise race car flick Days Of Thunder (some friends of mine, the Belmont Playboys, were the house band that evening). Cash, along with June Carter Cash, Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter, had arrived as the guests of Cruise\u0092s co-star Robert Duvall. I had to go shake his hand, saying to him, \u0093Mr. Cash, I think you\u0092re gonna like this band that\u0092s fixing to play.\u0094 In that unmistakable deep baritone of his he replied, \u0093Thank you son, I\u0092m sure I will.\u0094 And \u0096 oh boy, by night\u0092s end the entire posse \u0096 Johnny, Waylon, June, Jessi, even Duvall \u0096 were up onstage, taking turns at the mic and eventually leading the entire room in a group singalong for \u0093Will The Circle Be Unbroken.\u0094 A night to tell the grandkids. Thanks, Mr. Cash \u0096 it sure sounded like you were enjoying the band.<p>\r\n\r\nQUOTES (AS GIVEN TO ME) OF THE YEAR:<p>\r\n\r\nLoretta Lynn (queen of country music), on The Dixie Chicks, George Bush, etc.: \u0093Well, that was a thing that shouldn\u0092t have been said. I\u0092m gonna say what Mommy said to me. When I was growing up she said, \u0091Loretta, if you\u0092re gonna say something about somebody, make it good. If you can\u0092t say anything good, don\u0092t say nothing at all.\u0092 Me and Crystal Gale and my sister Peggy Sue. We went politicking for George Bush the first. We only got to go one day, but we tore up Illinois, I\u0092ll tell ya that. We rode this old school bus and we had a ball! You know, I had never done anything like that before. So we got into doing stuff like that and we loved it. Of course, George had us up there for a lot of reasons, you know. A lot of times it was just standing there, anything that was gonna go on, George had us there. And Jeb Bush, every time I see him and they\u0092re saying something about him, it hurts me, because, you know, it\u0092s like one of mine, my closest people. So like you said, if you can\u0092t say nothing nice, don\u0092t say nothing at all. What\u0092s happened to people like that? I just don\u0092t understand what it\u0092s all about for this generation.\u0094<p>\r\n\r\nJack White, on songwriting and authenticity: \u0093The problem with a lot of modern music [is that] a lot of songwriters try to pretend that they just exist in a vacuum, that they have no influences. But the important part, if you\u0092re calling yourself a musician or a songwriter, is to acknowledge the history of the songwriters and of the storytelling. Acknowledge who did it better before you. And if you\u0092re doing anything interesting, to carry on that tradition, to carry those stories on. That\u0092s what people don\u0092t understand. A lot of musicians nowadays, if they\u0092re at a party, say, with a bunch of aunts and uncles, and you said, \u0091Hey, sit down at the piano and play us a song \u0096 you\u0092re a musician, aren\u0092t you?\u0092 And they wouldn\u0092t be able to do it, you know? \u0091Oh, I need my amplifier and my effects pedals\u0085\u0092 That\u0092s far from embracing the history of storytelling.\u0094<p>\r\n\r\nRobby Krieger (Doors guitarist), responding to accusations that he and founding Door Ray Manzarek, by touring as \u0093The Doors Of The 21st Century\u0094 with The Cult\u0092s Ian Astbury sitting in for the, er, notably absent Jim Morrison, are, at best, a tribute act and, at worst, an exercise in rank cynicism:  \u0093I understand that. But you know, people are always gonna say that no matter what. There\u0092s always gonna be people, the purists who are never gonna be satisfied until Jim comes back. [laughing]  I don\u0092t think it\u0092s gonna happen.\u0094<p>\r\n\r\nMojo Nixon (Toadliquor, \u009180s MTV troubadour, now a DJ for a San Diego classic rock station), on his transition from indie-rock rabble-rouser to drive-time jock:  \u0094One thing I will say is that no one [from station management] has told me NOT to say something, and I\u0092ve been saying some crazy shit. But between Howard Stern and Bill Clinton, the line is gone. I am in the belly of the beast now, the Clear Channel devil. And as you know, when you get in bed with the devil, he\u0092s gonna fuck you in the ass! You can hold out for a little while, but eventually an ass-fucking is gonna take place. But yeah, I thought about it ten years ago that I should eventually do something else. I mean, I made 10 albums \u0096 isn\u0092t that enough? [laughs] Plus, another one of my talents is just telling the truth real loud, drunkenly over a microphone, and nowadays, on the radio, I just blurt it out, and it gives me great joy and glee to blurt it out, to say that the emperor has no clothes. I get people calling me up saying, \u0093Man, I never know what you\u0092re gonna say. You\u0092re saying the things we\u0092re thinking but are afraid to say!\u0094<p> \r\n\r\nMartin Slattery (Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros multiinstrumentalist), on his late friend and bandleader: \u0093Joe could have made hundreds of thousands of pounds guesting on other people\u0092s albums, showing up for this, showing up for that, but he wouldn\u0092t do any of it. He was about creating music for himself and for him to be able to perform and give to all the people. And the guy bore a lot. He took a lot of his shoulders: his band, his family, hundreds of thousands of people who he felt musically responsible to. He had a lot on his plate, and he dealt with it amazingly. He was one of the most naturally spiritual men I\u0092ve ever met. You read books about Daoism and stuff like that, the way that it talks about going with your life \u0096 don\u0092t fight what\u0092s happening, move with the world. And obviously he fought it lyrically, but he was always cool, whatever went down. He moved and he talked with that humble authority. He [was] into the individual: You\u0092ve gotta do what\u0092s right for you. Which is another kind of Daoist principle. You\u0092ve gotta follow what\u0092s in your heart and not what\u0092s in someone else\u0092s heart. Tuning into your own spirit and whatever.  That\u0092s what people should take from Joe. The fact that he came from what he did \u0096 at one point he was digging graves and at another part he was playing at Shea Stadium! That\u0092s the spirit of an individual, and that\u0092s what people need to carry with them, you know? I feel that very strongly. Again, in reference to the spiritual thing, that\u0092s very much what that whole ethos is about. Finding \u0096 I don\u0092t want to use the word \u0093God\u0094 but I can\u0092t think of another \u0096 the self within, the God within, and not someone else to rely on. And he did that, you know? It was incredible. That incredible energy that you get from that.\u0094<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n")

  "Honorable mentions: [21-23 above --dougo] I haven't bought Pelican's \"Australasia\" - I suspect it would be here if I had, I dig the little I've heard a lot.<p>Reissues: Led Zep's How the West Was Won was pretty great, but I think I have enough live Zep now. I highly recommend the reish of Bevis Frond's New River Head (Rubrik) if you don't have it - along with Valedictory Songs, the best Bevis out of many many LPs (and I do have them all...) New issue includes the entire original 2LP plus bonus tracks.</p>\r\n<p>I would've included the Strokes Room on Fire in this list if they didn't play like machines and make their records sound so tinny. Either the drummer can out-machine Robert Gotobed or this is the most pro-tooled record ever. The sound is purposefully thin, despite costing lots of money no doubt. But Casablancas does have a good voice and is not without talent lyrically. \"Automatic Stop\" was definitely one of my favorite songs of 2003. Standard hype rules apply - not as good as the hype, not as bad as detractors claim. As far as other 2003 hype acts, I dug the single from the new White Stripes LP, but didn't buy the album cause I felt so very, very burned by the previous LP that I bought out of curiosity. Yeah Yeah Yeahs Fever to Tell was better than I expected. Good production, nice and short, some interesting guitar playing, great drumming, Karen O is good though emotionally limited, her repeat the same word over and over trick gets used a few too many times. Grandaddy - wake me when it's over, please. So very dull, and plinky and blah...I liked the picture of them picking up trash in a park, though. This would also be the year that Yo La Tengo officially lost me. Despite repeated listens, I just could not connect with Summer Sun. I'll check back in if they ever make something rock-oriented again. Hell, song-oriented for that matter. If I want Brazilian or French flavors, or mood music, I've got those records already. Would someone please remind YLT that they're from Jersey? I just don't need the subdued bleeps and blorps and 'hey look, we just made all this stuff up!' feel of this album. They just sound lost and bored, but I suppose that appeals to some. I also keep hearing about some band called Radiohead. Didn't they have something to do with that schizo Wesley Willis guy in Chicago? Are they solo now? Naahhh, I'll pass. The singer sounds too much like Bono, can't get past that...besides I've heard a few too many times that some Brit darlings were revolutionary, then it always turns out to be revolutionary hairstyle, not music. I'm no Charlie Brown, I refuse to kick that ball! But I will admit to being a huge fan of Bernard Butler's 2nd album, so I'm not a total anglophobe...</p>")

In the meantime, please pick up Adam Green's latest solo album. Adam was one half of Moldy Peahces, along with Kimya Dawson. This is apparently a better record than Adam's previous outings (I haven't heard them), and it is better than the one Kimya I have heard. Imagine if Lee Hazelwood made bedroom recordings enhanced by strings from some kick ass folks like Jane Scarpantoni. Oh yeah, in this scenario, Lee will be mainly singing about incestual love, and other such topics in a juvenile fashion. It works. Well, for me it does.")

    "Sub Pop"
    "This is one of those records where every song sorta sounds like the same song repeated over and over, but it's a really awesome song, and you always reach for this record, because it's filled with spit and piss, but is also very self-aware. \"Hardly art/Hardly starving/Hardly art/Hardly garbage\" they sing, really fast and angry like the indie world is crumbling.")
   ("The Notwist"
    "Neon Golden"
    "Domino"
    "I know this was originally released last year and garnered many votes from the chugchanga crowd, but I heard it for the first time this year, and technically this is a re-release with 3 completely useless bonus instrumental tracks! The rest of the songs, however, are actual songs, with quiet melodies, vaguely electronic, but using varied instrumentation. Nett, sehr nett. If it doesn't count, use #21.")
   ("Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks"
    "Pig Lib"

    "Electric Version"
    "Matador"
    "This is nowhere near as good as _Mass Romantic_, so just stop that right now. This time, they're a little too pleased with their words, and their hooks. However, they still have Neko Case, who sounds better in this context than she does on her own. They need to keep Neko Case.")
   ("The Stokes"
    "Room on Fire"
    "RCA"
    "It's funny. I was disappointed with _Is This It_ because there was so much advance hype, that when I actually heard the record, I agreed with its title (also, there is the fact that I bought the import, which had what I still consider their best song, \"New York City Cops\", and then they removed it post -9/11 for the domestic issue, which was just stupid. Since when did punk become polite?). So, now there is this record, and there is the anticipation, and then the advance word was that it sounded the same as the last record, no movement, no improvement. So (part 2), I had low expectations. It sounds like the last record. Turns out I like that sound.")
   ("The White Stripes"
    "Elephant"
    "V2"
    "Again, somewhat disappointing, but still better than most of the junk out there. The singles sounded great on the radio, and I love \"There's No Home For You Here\" which sounds like Zeppelin (and there is no Zeppelin anymore, folks), and \"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine\" because I know a girl who has no faith in medicine. They seem to be getting worse, but they are still using their popularity to promote their art (I don't mean the beating up of guys in other garage bands), and we could have worse million sellers (and we do).")

    "An undeniable return to greatness from the best pop band of the 90's.  Trevor Horn's production adds a consistency that their post-Sinister efforts have lacked.  The multitude of genre exercises from new wave to soul to glam are all winners.")
   ("The Clientele"
    "The Violet Hour"
    " Merge"
    "Continues their formula of gauzy music, breathy vocals and blurry lyrics.  \"The House Always Wins\" is their 8+ minute centerpiece, promoting a feeling of escape punctuated with a sterling guitar solo.")
   ("My Favorite"
    "The Happiest Days Of Our Lives"
    "Double Agent"
    "If you're as much of a soft touch for morose 80's pop as I am and you don't own a My Favorite release yet, now is the time to rectify that gaping chasm in your collection!  The combination of three outstanding ep's combined with four new songs and a discload of remixes make this an unbeatable bargain.  Donnie Darko fans unite!")
   ("Ween"
    "Quebec"
    "Sanctuary"
    "Continues the theme of the previous two albums by intermingling reverent parodies of 70's musical genres and jaw-dropping guitar work.  My only complaint is the solos aren't nearly long enough.  They can jump from Zappa to Motorhead to prog and nail each one with a perfection that serious-minded mimickers only dream of approaching.")
   ("British Sea Power"
    "The Decline Of British Sea Power"
    "Rough Trade"
    "If their best days are behind them as the title implies, then I wish I knew of them earlier in their career.  Taking a page from unhinged 80's rock (think Birthday Party) and smoothing it out for the new century, this disc features recklessly emotional vocals and unleashed playing.  If not for two 10+ minute dirges it could've been my #1.")
   ("Kaada"
    "Thank You For Giving Me Your Valuable Time"
    "Ipecac"
    "I'm a sucker for a well-placed sample in the context of a traditional song and this album is chock full of 'em.  Not a pastiche like the Avalanches, but the songs are heavily influenced by various 60's and 70's era swipes.  Originally released in Norway a couple years ago, it was released to the US in 2003.")
   ("Radio Dept."
    "Lesser Matters"
    "Shelflife"
    "Not your typical Swedish pop band.  Their aspirations are grounded in early 90's fuzzpop with heavily obscured vocals and overmodulated instruments.  That doesn't mask the lyrical power of many of these tunes.")
   ("Alaisdar Roberts"
    "Farewell Sorrow"
    "Drag City"
    "A dead-on late 60's/early 70's British folk knock-off, my favorite elements of this disc are the loose out-of-sequence story formed by the songs and the consistency of his beloved's name in each one.  Viscerally paints a portrait of some long bygone era of rural British life and keeps it imprecise enough to warrant continued exploration")
   ("Pernice Brothers"
    "Yours, Mine and Ours"
    "Ashmont"
    "Took a little bit longer than normal to warm up to the latest Pernice Brothers outing but when the quality finally shone through it lifted this one up amongst its predecessors.  Some of the 80's swipes are more obvious, but no less enjoyable.")
   ("Zongamin"
    "Zongamin"
    "XL/Flesh"
    "An all-instrumental disc with a great mix of styles, including funk, disco, choppy new wave and what seems to be a call for breakdancing.  Each tune shines within its genre and grabs hold without getting too repetitive.")
   ("The Innocence Mission"
    "Befriended"
    "Badman"
    "How many albums did we have to endure this year featuring the hip new concept of married couples making music together?  These two have been creating blissful folk-pop for over ten years now, and this album continues their winning mixture of gorgeous guitar work and heavenly vocals.")
   ("Wheat"
    "Per Second, Per Second, Per Second ... Every Second"
    "Aware/Columbia"
    "Saddled with perhaps the lousiest album title this year, Wheat's bid for the mainstream smartly polishes their sound without alienating the old fans.  Fridmann's production can often be too busy for me, but here it's restrained enough to compliment the songs without overwhelming them.")
   ("The Sprites"
    "Starling, Spiders, Tiger and Sprites"
    "March"
    "I questioned Jason Korzen's sanity for disbanding his wonderful new wave group Barcelona, but he's rewarded us with this wonderful new concern.  It has a very Lucksmiths feel to it, but trades clever wordplay for sentimental sincerity.  That's an improvement in my mind.")
   ("The Decemberists"
    "Castaways And Cutouts"
    "Kill Rock Stars"
    "The Decemberists had two 2003 releases this year, but I'm selecting this 2002 re-issue of their debut for my list. Contains what could be my favorite line of the year, \"I figured I'd paid my debt to society/by paying my overdue fines at the Multnomah county library\"")
   ("Sloan"
    "Action Pact"
    "ViK"
    "OK, it's not their best album.  It's probably not even mid-pack.  But it contains one of their finest songs ever \"False Alarm\" plus several more that back it up strongly.  And that's good enough in my book for a spot in the top 20.")
   ("Yeah Yeah Yeahs"
    "Fever To Tell"
    "Interscope"
    "A bit of a disappointment considering how strong their ep was, but still more than engaging enough to include on the list.  The songs are far too underwritten but Karen pulls off a decent portion of them, including the year's best ballad, \"Maps.\"")
   ("Ronderlin"
    "Wave Another Day Goodbye"
    "Hidden Agenda"
    "A traditional Swedish pop band that staved off my jones for a new Eggstone release, at least for another year.  Wonderful touches abound, including some nice horns, keyboards and equal dashes of the Beatles and the Smiths.")
   ("Owl & The Pussycat"
    "Owl & The Pussycat"
    "Kill Rock Stars"
    "Lois Maffeo teamed up with 70's retro-popper Greg Moore to create simple and catchy slices of indie-pop for our enjoyment.  Lois can carry the disc on her voice alone, but when lent to such lovely songs it's difficult to resist.")
   ("Bishop Allen"
    "Charm School"
    "Self-released"
    "Former Boston area lo-fi punkers go to college, find a few female bandmates, and morph into a cheery little pop outfit.  It's impossible to stifle the desire to clap along and tap your tones to the outlandishly catchy but simply constructed tunes."))

Too incredibly cheesy for me to even appreciate ironically.\r\n<li><strong>Natacha Atlas</strong> <cite>Something Dangerous</cite><br />\r\nSome good techno-ish moments here (\"Daymalhum\", \"Like the Last Drop\"), but the rest is syrupy overproduced \"world music\".\r\n<li><strong>The Coral</strong> <cite>The Coral</cite><br />\r\nSome sort of sea-shanty/pirate rock, which sounds like a neat idea but it doesn't really work in practice.\r\n<li><strong>The Dead C</strong> <cite>The Damned</cite><br />\r\nTry as I might, I just can't get into the Dead C.  A couple tracks from this are OK (\"Truth\" and \"Heat\") but the rest just exceeds my tolerance for atonal arrhythmic feedbacky cacophany.  I still love Skullflower, though.\r\n<li><strong>Delays</strong> <cite>Hey Girl</cite><br />\r\nI like their <cite>Nearer Than Heaven</cite> EP, but this one has just a bit too much of the '80s college rock sound for me to stomach.\r\n<li><strong>Missy Elliott</strong> <cite>This Is Not A Test!</cite><br />\r\nI liked \"Get Ur Freak On\" and a few other singles, but these tracks are all either dull or annoying.\r\n<li><strong>Thee Midniters</strong> <cite>Greatest</cite><br />\r\nI thought they were a surf/garage band for some reason, but this is mostly watered-down soul.  \"Land of a Thousand Dances\" is the highlight, but it's still a pretty weak version.\r\n<li><strong>Spiritualized</strong> <cite>Amazing Grace</cite><br />\r\nNot as terrible as <cite>Let It Come Down</cite>, but still pretty lame.  It's becoming clear that <cite>Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space</cite> was not a breath of new life but more like a last gasp.\r\n<li><strong>The Strokes</strong> <cite>Room On Fire</cite><br />\r\nLess annoying than <cite>Is This It?</cite>, but I'll chalk that up as a sophomore slump.\r\n</ul>"))
