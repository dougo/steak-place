  "2002 seems to have been a rather tame year for me.  I moved for the second time in two years in early February, and this time about as deep into the mountains of Colorado as one could get.  And that may have had an influence on my on purchasing habits - I mean, I did't purchase much, but I think what I did, I happened to like quite a bit.  I continued mostly in the Fahey-esque traditions, with new stuff and old, and it seems to me that I wasn't the only one.  And, well, I'm not really saying anything of much importance, so without further adue (how the hell are you supposed to even spell \"adue\" ? - maybe that's it, but if not, we'll just leave it at that)."
  (("Jack Rose"
    "Red Horse, White Mule"
    "Eclipse"
    "I think that this record will top, or at least be included in, roughly 300 year end list entries, as for some god foresaken reason, there were only 300 copies pressed.  Why this was released in such small numbers and with so little push is beyond me.  This could have been released on a number of labels and been one of \"the bigger\" records of the year, but maybe that's just me since this record is *SO* up my alley it's kind of funny.  Given my age, I think it's appropriate that I have only been listening to John Fahey since the release of his Return of the Repressed introduction (an introduction that gave me a belly ache if I listened to in full, but a few years later led the introduction into his cataloque of greater, even more memorable moments), but I have been waiting a LONG time for someone to make another record like this.  O'rouke came close with two awful nice attempts in his own warped sense of way, but this one is really what I was looking for.  Fare Forward Voyagers Part II.  This is as sweet as it gets.  And I think I'm the last one to ever have guessed it would have ever come from one of the players of Pelt (or at least prior to 2000).  I hope this sees the light of day in a larger release in 2003, or that Jack makes another that only puts this one to shame.  Record on....")
   ("Matt Valentine"
    "Tonight!  One Night Only!  MV & EE in Heaven"
    "Time-Lag Records"
    "Shit.  Another record that will likely be featured in yet another 300 year end lists.  What the hell's up with all the editions of 300 of late?  And this one is even pressed in MONO?  Regardless, one of the best releases of 2002 that now I am recalling was also released on CD (or the ever obvious CD-R), but I suspsect that release may have only been an even smaller private pressing.  Again, expecting a record like this to come from a band member who in 1994 released a indie rock record like he did with the Tower Recordings debut, I would have never guessed an lp worth of tunes like this would turn up.  And did I mention this record looks about as swell as one of Fahey's own fine gatefold's, America?  Very, very nice.  I hope to hear more from this fellow.")
   ("Neil Halstead"
    "Sleeping on Roads"
    "4AD"
    "So a little change of pace here with this one, but considering how many times this got played, I have to list it sooner or later.  I believe this was released in the UK in 2001, but definitely a 2002 stateside release, and I am definitely stateside, so how appropriate.  With two Fahey tribute records above, this one now goes to Nick Drake.  And very well done at that.")
   ("Wilco"
    "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"
    "Nonesuch"
    "Well, you either liked this record, or you downloaded it 2001 and tried to ignore the hype since you did.  I am definitely of the former catagory, and can't say that I have heard anything else from Wilco, but when this came out I was surely impressed.")
   ("Wire"
    "Read and Burn 01"
    "Pink Flag"
    "Definitelty the mostly highly anticipated record of 2002 for me, and I was surely far from let down.  In fact, I think I was pretty much thrown across the room that late June afternoon when I first heard this.  Not a bum cut on here, and I think the worst on here still sounds as great as your least favorite track on Pink Flag.  ")
   ("Sun City Girls"
    "High Asia * Lo-Pacific"
    "Abduction"
    "Number 9 and 10 of their seemingly never ending (but possibly this was the last one?) Carnival Folklore Resurrection series, this one definitely has to be my favorite.  Platter one is a rather varied afair, and so good at that, while platter two is a 30-some minute sprawl into one of their stranger efforts if that is all possible.  It took me about six months to actually get around to playing the second disc, but it was definitely worth the wait.  Can't compare this to their more recent efforts released on tour this past fall, but if they surpass this, I would be awful surprised.")
   ("The Dead C"
    "New Electric Music"
    "Language Recordings"
    "It's a year end list, and it's a Dead C record.  The two have gone hand in hand, at least in this household, since what, 1993?  I didn't see a lot of hype following this one, but I am positive it was \"released\" in 2002, and what a hummer it was.  Killer, the opener, was far from that, and would have been a more appropriate title for what follows with track 2, Hush.  An extended remix of Sky?  Well, I think this about as close as one could get.  And let me tell you, it fucking rocks.  The mid-section of NEM is sometimes just there, but mention here is almost required for the for the final 30 minute track where about 26 minutes in literally blows my mind.  Nice.")
   ("Spoon"
    "Kill The Moonlight"
    "Merge"
    "Another surprising record for me in 2002.  The band has been around since what, 1995?  Maybe so, and I don't know how those prior records compare, but this was easly one of my more listened to records for the year.  Short.  Strange.  And to the point.  ")
   ("Henry Flynt"
    "C Tune"
    "Locust"
    "Ok, how did I forget this one?  Definately worthy of something higher than a lowly number 9, this is easly my favorite of Flynt's amazing (and amazingly varied) catalog that has surfaced the past 24 months.  I'm still missing the more recent \"Back Porch Hillbilly Blues\" (I believe that's what they are called), and I promise you I will get around to those soon, but for the time being, 9 or 10 months later, this one easily still has my attention.  Tony Conrad made for easy listening.")
   ("The Mountain Goats"
    "Tallahassee/All Hail West Texas"
    "4AD/Emp. Jones"
    "Surely not a joint release, but two fine, fine records released by John in 2002.  And not to mention the Extra Glenns released their first last year as well, or even the third and final installment in the Ajax/3bos compilations.  Big year for l'il John.  Tallahassee was the \"major label debut\", nicely polished and even produced, while West Texas was total picture perfect form that we have all come to expect since the days of his crayon-ed cassettes.  His best stories yet.  The \"god damn\" line early on should reach classic status here soon.")
   ("No Neck Blues Band"
    "Re: \"Mr. A Fan...\""
    "Trade Mark of Quality"
    "I'm still not sure what to think of this record, but I am guessing the TMoQ thing is somewhat out of joke, or maybe not.  What the hell does a band like No Neck need with a bootleg release?  Regardless, this is a fine one with moments that equal and expand in a rougher sense all the great moments of last year's best record by noneother than themselves.")
   ("Doctor Ragtime"
    "s/t"
    "Tequila Sunrise"
    "Ok, so this is getting a little ridiculous to mention, but Jack Rose apparantly played some dates in 2002 that explored the sort of thing we learned with last year's unbelieveable Charley Patton set, and here's a small document of just that.  It says here that only 60 copies of this CD-R were made, and again, like his long-player on Eclipse, that's surely a shame.  There has to be more than 60 people in the world that would agree that this is some of the finest playing either side of the Mississippi. I'm glad I stumbled upon this one.")

    "Post-rock? Post-punk? Post-puh! We don\222t need no steenkin\222 post-whatever. Formerly of Sacramento and now residing in the steaming jungles of Brooklyn, O.H. channels everything from A Certain Ratio\222s punk-funk to New Order\222s electro throb to the classic On-U Sound dub-hop stylee to Can\222s vintage Prog-jazz fusion. The 38-minute album unfolds effortlessly and seamlessly, layering synth- and cello-strewn soundscapes against insistent percussion manifestos, simultaneously freeing the proverbial ass and mind.\r\n")

    "Here Be Monsters"
    "Capitol"
    "With arrangements as trippingly dark and orchestral as the Flaming Lips\222, cerebrally provocative lyrics on par with some of Tom Waits\222 or Randy Newman\222s and a general production ethos descended from Brian Wilson, Todd Rundgren and Sir George Martin, Harcourt\222s debut  is the bravest, most compelling UK export since OK Computer. And sure, Harcourt is the latest in a long line of singing-songwriting bruised romantics, but blessed with a throat and a vocal delivery that brings to mind Jeff Buckley channeling Van Morrison, he comes across as absolutely genuine. And ladies, he\222s a charming, good looking sonofabitch, too.\r\n")
   ("Maquiladora"
    "Ritual Of Hearts"
    "Better Looking"
    "San Diego trio Maquiladora shares with Neil Young a knack for infusing minimalist sketches with a richly cinematic, wide-open-spaces vibe. Unfolding like a druggy fever dream, third album has the same stark austerity that marked Young\222s Sleeps With Angels; it also contains Giant Sand\222s Chore Of Enchantment brand of losing-control wooziness. Maybe even some of Spiritualized\222s gospel drone, too. This intersection of drunken psychedelia and manic folk thrill, with piano, synth, melodica, mandolin, accordion and more darting like honeybees, proposes a craftsman\222s worldview that is deeply passionate.\r\n\r\n")

The band\222s diseased DNA dump spawned, of course, both Pere Ubu and the Dead Boys. Meanwhile, these \22275 rehearsal and live sessions gang-rape such virginal pop delights as Ubu\222s totemic \22330 Seconds Over Tokyo\224 and the Boys\222 ur-Stooges \223Sonic Reducer,\224 not to mention a mandatory Velvets cover.

    "The Lips\222 quest to paint their fans\222 minds in Technicolor didn\222t simply materialize out of thin air with The Soft Bulletin or this year\222s Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. Recorded evidence stretching as far back to 1984 \226 recaptured on the three-CD Finally\205and its two-CD retarded kid brother The Day\205-- suggests the Lips had already mastered the  rudiments of unscrewing noggins and ladling in the day-glo goop. The then-now contrast is like the difference between the Beatles playing amped-up R&B at Hamburg\222s Star Club and crafting Sgt. Pepper\222s in a London studio, but the thrill of discovery is sublimely visceral.\r\n")

    "Polydor UK"
    "For a Jam fan not previously serviced by the bootleg industry, indispensable: three discs featuring a trio of Peel sessions and a trio of BBC \223In Concert\224 broadcasts. Plus the obligatory collectors\222 booklet. It\222s a fascinating evolution-by-performance of the band, covering the 1977-81 period (which, considering the band\222s output in those days, covers a lot of artistic ground). The Jam was one of my first deep loves of the punk/new wave era in terms of a group I sought out and collected every piece of vinyl and memorabilia I could get my hands on. This brings a lot of that lovely obsession back home again.\r\n")

DJ Shadow made a pilgrimage to Texas to find the faces behind the funk, ultimately rounding up all existing tapes, including a slew of never-released material, for this two-CD masterpiece (which includes his detailed liner notes). If nothing else, the throbbing, whomp \221n\222 grind psychedelic sprawl of the title cut is a must-listen.

When Tucson wunderkind guitarist/Giant Sand collaborator Rainer Ptacek died in \22297 shortly after I\222d returned to the Old Pueblo, I found it hard for awhile to listen to his records. I got over that, of course, and nowadays he\222s in constant rotation in the Mills playbox. (His Nocturnes CD of atmospheric instrumentals was what Allison and I were listening to in the delivery room in \22201 shortly before Eli was born). The Farm is the third of a posthumous trilogy that Rainer\222s widow, friend Howe Gelb and German label Glitterhouse assembled, and it\222s as moving as any disc I\222ve heard all year. Small wonder; these dreamy folk extrapolations and cranky blues workouts were recorded just mere weeks before the cancer got the best of him. It\222s the sound of a man staring over the edge and into the abyss and having absolutely no fear \226 just embracing the preciousness of life as best he can, for as long as he can.\r\n")

Later adding keyboards, tapes and assorted stringed things, SavRep wound up lasting for four albums eight years and numerous lineup changes.

  "The Year In Rock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a fantastic year to be a lover of music and a collector of same. I can\222t recall a year in which I found more tunes to make my paws sweat (or palms hairy, take your pick). This was true both on the new release front and in the archival divisions, too. Stuff going on in the music biz fascinated me as well, in equal measures thrilling and appalling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyway, someone who says that the quality of music out there has declined and that is why the record biz is in such dire straits, well, that pinhead ain\222t been looking for music in the right places. Granted, the actual crap \226 which is always with us, let\222s face it \226 is monumentally crappier. But the biz has been performing a tight-wire act for some time now; it\222s just that in 2002, folks realized there was no safety net down below. Besides, who says you have to consume crap, right? Who says you have to listen to bad radio when there are plenty of thriving noncommercial community radio stations (hint: donate to \221em at pledge time), not to mention an insane number of Webcasters? No, like I said, anybody who tries to claim this was a lame year clearly has been walking around with his head in a duffel-sack. Or listening to the Clear Channel, haw-haw-haw! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I\222m as bone-weary of the mainstream rock and pop pap as Tom Petty, but the bulk of college-radio\222s indie-rock staples are just as formulaic and uninspiring in their identikit grovelings too. I mean, c\222mon. OK Go? Fine by me \226 go, now! Interpol? Call the feds! Royksopp? Saps\205 Nor do I have much truck with all the sad-sack populist hipsters who constantly weigh in on what\222s wrong with the music biz \226 you know, the folks who counter the R.I.A.A.\222s whining about piracy and CD burning with their own tiresome mantras about high CD prices and shitty tunes. Wake up, folks: for every overpriced $19.98 piece-of-crap CD released this year, there were probably 20 great discs \226 not all of them indies, either -- that came in under the twelve-buck mark. Sure, you may have to drag your lazy ass away from your X-Box long enough to do some online hunting. You might even have to put down that latte for a few minutes and \226 gasp! \226 drive across town to paw through a record store\222s bins. But remember that line from The Big Chill, about growing up an\222 shit?  It applies to being a music lover, too: Nobody every said it was gonna be easy. I think back to an old episode of I.R.S.\222 Cutting Edge when R.E.M.\222s Peter Buck was talking about some of the great underground music of the day. At one point he looked directly into the camera and (roughly paraphrased) said, \223It\222s your duty as Americans to go out and find this stuff.\224 Thanks, Pete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2002: SEND IN THE CLOWNS: Boy, what a crazy year this has been in the music world, huh! How crazy was it? Glad you asked. Crazy enough that the one of the year\222s most cynical albums, Tom Petty\222s The Last DJ, was also one of the most sentimental releases. Crazy enough that one the darkest, Steve Earle\222s Jerusalem, turned out to be one of the most optimistic. Crazy enough that one of the most serious, Beck\222s Sea Change, was simultaneously one of the funniest -- albeit unintentionally so: dude, get a grip, like, love fucking hurts, okay? Crazy enough that\205.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(1) One of the most anticipated archival releases, Dylan\222s The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Live 1975 The Rolling Thunder Revue, was almost upstaged at year\222s end by a genuine bootleg on the Japanese Main Stream label. As riveting and spiffy-sounding as the official Zimmy \221leg was (that freebie DVD single wasn\222t unwelcome either), the cumbersomely-titled After 37 Years, Bring It All Back To Newport had the curious effect of feeling both contemporary and ancient, and with a distinct double-whiff of historical significance, too. A moderately good-sounding audience recording of Dylan\222s August 3, 2002 concert at the Apple & Eve Newport Folk Festival (in Newport, RI), it found The Bard returning to the scene of the crime some three-decades-plus hence, this time plugged-in and gunning for blood from the git-go with a set that, unlike other concerts from his 2002 tour, focused almost exclusively on songs he penned during the \22160s (only a handful of tracks from Love & Theft were performed). Attired in tall white Stetson and sporting a freaky long beard/wig look the man plowed into his folkrock era-heavy set with a bile-spewing vengeance. Seems that no matter how much longer Dylan may live, he\222s determined to get the last laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2) One of the most backstory-heavy, labored-over and thematically intense albums, Springsteen\222s The Rising, didn\222t completely liberate its audience as intended (from the daunting psychic baggage of 9/11) until its songs were given a chance to spread their wings live. Which, with Boss tunes, is always the correct context.  While we all know music takes on new meaning, texture and flavor in concert, there was something absolutely spontaneous and celebratory about Rising material performed on the 2002 tour, particularly when sequenced in with some of Springsteen\222s best older numbers.  If you don\222t believe me, try this simple test. Pull out your Bruce recs and program this actual (partial) concert sequence in the privacy of your own home: The Rising/ Lonesome Day/ The Ties That Bind/ Candy's Room/ Night/Empty Sky/ You're Missing/ Waitin' on a Sunny Day. If that doesn\222t make you feel better about a whole lot of things \226 9/11 included \226 you need professional help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(3) As long as I\222ve brought up Earle, Springsteen and 9/11, among the various other rock community stabs at dealing with our national tragedy, some of the most high-profile ones (both Neil Young\222s occasionally turgid and lyrically awkward \223Let\222s Roll\224 and Tori Amos\222 excruciating/embarrassing full-length parable of navel-gazing travelogue, Scarlet\222s Walk, come to mind) wound up being the least memorable. Yet those given to flying way under the industry radar (for example, The Residents\222 oddly vulnerable Demons Dance Alone and  Legendary Pink Dots\222 provocative All The King\222s Men) wound up being the most affecting tomes, with Sleater-Kinney\222s awesome One Beat  perhaps the most skillful juggling of grief and outrage heard anywhere. The three ladies performed like champs, with the finesse of seasoned tunesmiths thrice their group age; they even were frequently heard tying together a few generational loose ends by covering Springsteen in concert. And let us not forget the mighty Sonic Youth, whose expansive and hypnotic Murray Street, while not intended as a 9/11 record per se but as part of a larger Manhattan trilogy, offered a much-needed warm bath, a tall glass of milk and a plate of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(4) In a year where we finally reconciled ourselves to the fact that, given George Harrison\222s death in late \22201, there really, no really, there ain\222t gonna be no Beatles reunion \226 we received not one but two reunions. Okay, technically, Back In The U.S. Live 2002 is a Paul McCartney tour rec, but damn, its Fab Four-heavy, career-spanning setlist sure brings a smile to my face, and it plays like the Live Beatles Album We Never Thought We\222d Hear. And leave it to jambanders Phish to do the deed even prouder: Live Phish 13: 10.31.94 included the entire friggin\222 White Album performed onstage, song-by-song, in the proper running order. Now THAT (along with similar Phish treatments of The Who\222s Quadrophenia, Talking Heads\222 Remain In Light and Velvet Underground\222s Loaded on three of its other live archival releases) is entertainment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(5) With 2002 being the most un-funky year in recent memory (pissed-off snipers, drunk airline pilots, horny priests, a right-wing monkey-not-funky as president and, um, Michael Jackson\222s nose), it was pretty damn ironic that it was also a year in which some of the funkiest music in years was either created or resurrected. Whether or not there was something happening on the musical astral plane this year is hard to say, but it can\222t be mere coincidence that we had labels like NYC\222s Soul Fire, Britain\222s Jazz Man and Brooklyn\222s Daptone digging into the funk \221n\222 soul vaults as well as serving up likeminded contemporary artists (Lee Fields, Sharon Jones, Sugarman 3, etc.) as well. Shoot, even \22170s legends The Jimmy Castor Bunch got a well-timed anthologizing courtesy RCA\222s 16 Slabs Of Funk. And George Clinton & the P-Funk All-Stars toured like muh-fuhs\205 The mothership touched down in Mama Africa as well, courtesy Antibalas\222 Fela-centric Talkatif, while a superb afro-rock compilation, sensibly titled Afro-Rock Volume One, helped expand upon the context from which Fela himself emerged. And both veteran funk-fiend D.J. Shadow (The Private Press) and upstart RJD2 (Deadringer) delivered the sampladelic goods; Shadow even made a trip all by his lonesome to Texas where he dug deep into the Lone Star vaults and came up with an ace 2-CD funk artifact from the \22170s, Mickey and the Soul Generation\222s Iron Leg. Something\222s going on around here, without a doubt, but you don\222t know what it is, do ya, Massa Jones?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(5) More than a few of us noticed that the one of the year\222s most anticipated reissues, the remastered, expanded-to-two-discs version of John Coltrane\222s A Love Supreme (okay, okay, so that expanded Pavement rec was pretty spiffy, too!), was joined in the stores by one of the most unexpected but altogether brilliant pieces of music journalism, too. Writer Ashley Kahn\222s A Love Supreme: The Story Of John Coltrane\222s Signature Album has everything you\222d want from a great book: detail, drama, insight, insiderdom, passion, purity. Coming at the topic not from a dry jazz scholar\222s point of view but as a true music obsessive who wants it all \226 the tunes as well as the tales \226 Kahn spun a riveting story. Even better: there\222s already a soundtrack \226 remastered, expanded, etc. -- to go with that story. Here\222s hoping Hollywood never gets ahold of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGOING OUT WITH A BANG: If 2002 represented the rockisback! zeitgeist, rock deaths made a big comeback this year, too. The Who\222s John Entwistle, of course, expired in a Vegas hotel room after an evening of hookers and blow after he conveniently forgot that he was supposed to be on heart medication. Alice In Chains\222 erstwhile vocalist Layne Staley and the Ramones\222 founding bassist Dee Dee Ramone joined the choir invisible, at ages 34 and 50 respectively, after indulging in too much chemical fun, although what was infinitely more entertaining was watching all the usual media suspects trotting out all the usual hand-wringing clich\351s: immensely talented musicians, loved by fans and friends, crippled by psychic pain, \223the tortured artist effect,\224 blah-blah-blah. Bah. Spare me the memorials. When some so-called \223tortured artist\224 holes up in room for that last hot shot, in his egomania he betrays his fans and loved ones and surrenders the right to be remembered in anything other than strict clinical terms \226 just another dead fucking junkie, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTRUMMER, R.I.P.: By contrast, the immediate and widespread reaction to Clash/Mescaleros mainman Joe Strummer\222s untimely, unglamorous and, aside from a lifetime of smoking, un-chemical demise (a heart attack, at age 50) was heartfelt and ultimately well-positioned, with genuinely moving testimony arriving from pundits who came of age during the Clash\222s tenure as \223the only band that matters.\224 I was privileged enough to have interviewed Strummer twice, and in person he was as feisty and droll as I\222d imagined he would be, setting my fanboy ass straight on a number of matters. At one point he good-naturedly derailed me, as I wandered too deeply into old-news territory, with a succinct, \223Don\222t you want to know when the Clash are going to get back together?\224 And in a weird, admittedly morbid and perverse, sense, Strummer\222s death is perfect. No doubt Joe himself, sitting up on high somewhere this very moment, is chuckling over the ludicrously middle-class nature of the circumstances surrounding his demise, this irascible, uncompromising punk firebrand decidedly not going out in a classic blaze of rock death glory. No fiery auto crash. No messy blood-and-syringe overdose. No onstage electrocution. \223Bit of a cosmic giggle \221ere, innit?\224 Strummer remarks, as he passes Joey Ramone a heavenly spliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZEVON, R.I.P. \226 NOT JUST YET:<br>\r\nStrummer\222s death, fascinatingly, caught journalists way off guard and without the safety net of a \223ready room\224 (one of several code names for where newspapers maintain extensive files of pre-mortem celeb obituaries). Perhaps that\222s why the media treatment rang all the truer. In the case of Warren Zevon, we have an even more fascinating scenario: The obits and memorials are actually being published prior to the wolfman\222s passage into the great gig in the sky. This seems perfect (and yeah, morbid and perverse) too; everyone has fantasies about being a fly on the wall at their own funeral in order to see what folks say about them. Zevon, of all people, is getting to live out that fantasy \226 and God bless \221im for that, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPAY TO PLAY VERSION 6.0: In an egregious demonstration of how not to behave ethically, a heretofore obscure music website, NYRock.com, attempted to dismantle the division between advertising and editorial, ultimately setting off a firestorm on music-related Internet newsgroups (including a well-known mailing list of label publicists). NYRock.com instituted the following rule regarding reviews of independent bands\222 or labels\222 products: \223We have a $20 CD-review policy for all submissions from unsigned and independent-label bands. If you\222d like the CDs reviewed, please send payment\205.\224 Cough up an additional $10 and your photo can run with the review too. At first NYRock.com tried to justify its actions by citing the high cost of maintaining a commercial venture (gee, you\222d think they\222d try to sell, oh, advertising\205). Later, the site\222s sole fulltime employee, the enticingly anonymous Sandi Boerum (she appears nowhere on the masthead, which lists positions such as \223publisher\224 and \223editor\224 but no actual names to go with them) lamely defended the reviews policy by sniffing, \223NYRock.com is not the only publication to charge for reviews.\224 Please name names, Sandi, but meanwhile, didn\222t your mother tell you as a kid that two wrongs don\222t make a right? Or that just because Buffi and Traci go leaping off cliffs doesn\222t mean you have to do it too?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone is interested in reading more about this feel free to get in touch. You can view an editorial I wrote about the matter in the Detroit Metro Times (www.metrotimes.com , go to Music Section and scroll down to the article). Bottom line, and I quote from myself: I\222m deeply troubled on three fronts. One, that tiny labels and unknown bands, desperate for any press, will buy into this bill of goods. Secondly, that other publications, Web-based or print, may follow suit if this business model proves profitable. And finally, that if the line between \223real\224 journalism and the kind a NYRock.com-type practices increasingly becomes blurred, anything I write, as a member of an ethically-suspect profession, will automatically have less credibility. Fascinatingly, Boerum came out of the woodwork after I wrote the thing, whining of mean and abusive treatment on my part, despite having repeatedly ignored my requests for an interview beforehand. But what Boerum and other folks like her \226 I\222m sure you know the type, people who arrived late to the party and suddenly decided, particularly with the advent of the Internet, that they could hitch a free and even profitable ride to the rock \221n\222 roll mule train \226 don\222t get and never will get is that there\222s something just a little bit sacred about this thing we call music, and you have to respect that sacred ground by behaving with at least a modicum of ethical responsibility. I know that mainstream newspaper journalists treat their craft in that regard, so why shouldn\222t those of us in the music end of journalism do likewise? Read on\205.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPAY TO PLAY VERSION 6.0.5: In 2002 I accomplished my goal of publishing 300 record reviews. The tally would have been higher but I have a 2-year old. Of those reviews, more than a third were of CDs and LPs I bought -- as opposed to being assigned by some editor desperate to suck up to publicists or sell a few more label ads off my blood, sweat and tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a writer, though, since I received the same 1,850 promos and saw the same publicists\222 pitches as everyone else did this year, it became quite a jolly little diversion for me to open up music mags and pick out all those tidy little 250-word judgment calls that, in the final estimation, amounted to little more than back-scratching and favor-returning. In that regard, not every lesson we learned from Saint Lester Bangs and all the other pioneering roccrits of yore were necessarily good lessons. Sometimes, it\222s not prudent for journalists to be so deep in the pockets of the music biz that you can\222t see \226 or more important, talk about -- what\222s really going on, but for all the lint in your eyes. I know, I know \226 we\222re addicted to those promos, those guest list privileges, those drink tickets, the occasional junket, and of course that backstage access to the stars. But whoever said that rock writing had to turn into just another wing of the least credible (ethically speaking) career path, celebrity journalism?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHOPE I SELL OUT BEFORE I GET OLD, PT.1:  In 2002 everything was for sale, from personal dignity (halloo, Ozzy!) to Pete Townshend\222s back catalog. I shan\222t meditate unduly on whether Ol\222 Behind Blue Eyes should/should not license the Who\222s back catalog to every Tom, Dick, Harry, auto manufacturer or prime-time network television drama, and besides, a million Moby songs used in commercials and films can\222t be wrong, right?  Pity about that Clash song, though. Strummer and Jones approved, for a reported fee in the neighborhood of $500,000, the 45-day use by Jaguar of  \223London Calling.\224 This caused no shortage of gritted teeth and mutterings of \223sell-out!\224 among Clash hardliners. Sleater-Kinney\222s Janet Weiss, quoted in a Chicago Tribune article about rock music and advertising, summed up many fans\222 feelings by saying, \223It takes something I looked up to, that I used as my gauge, and wipes away my respect for everything the Clash did because they were so against the thing they are now representing in that ad.\224 Strummer managed a semi-justification in an interview with Salon, pointing out that they\222d never sold out to beer companies and how after enough time has elapsed, why shouldn\222t an artist make some scratch \226 particularly since the Clash didn\222t make that much money first time around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHOPE I SELL OUT BEFORE I GET OLD, PT. 2: Frito-Lay\222s biggest fan, Tom Waits, set things straight in an October letter to The Nation when he wrote, \223Songs carry emotional information and some transport us back to a poignant time, place or event in our lives. It's no wonder a corporation would want to hitch a ride on the spell these songs cast and encourage you to buy soft drinks, underwear or automobiles while you're in the trance\205Remember, when you sell your songs for commercials, you are selling your audience as well.\224 Chimed in John Densmore, who presumably is a bit more well-off monetarily than Waits, in a superb essay for Rolling Stone outlining why The Doors\222 music is not available for licensing (despite Ray Manzarek\222s urgings otherwise), \223The bottom line is that our songs have a higher purpose, like keeping the integrity of their original meaning for our fans\205 Robby [Krieger] hit a home run [saying], \221When I heard from one fan that our songs saved him from committing suicide, I realized that\222s it \226 we can\222t sell off these songs.\222\224 Of course, folks who cite Moby\222s successful song-licensing strategy as proof that the rantings of Densmore and Waits are just hippy-dreamer old-fogeyisms are convenient overlooking one fact: Most folks initially encountered Moby via his shilling for the man, not after they\222d endlessly scrutinized, cherished and made love to his Play album. Think about it: years from now, when people hear the name Dirty Vegas, they\222re gonna think of watching that slinkysexycool Mitsubishi Eclipse ad with the hot chick doing her pop-and-lock routine \226 not their first kiss at the high-school prom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEST TREND: Record labels have been serving up new releases that frequently include, for a limited time, cool add-ons such as bonus tracks and bonus discs (including DVDs), elaborate packaging, links to websites where you can stream or download exclusive content, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWORST TREND: Issuing the add-on packages months after the CD\222s initial release, i.e., forcing hard-core fans to buy the damn thing more than once! Oh well, that\222s what God created used CD stores for\205 or CD burners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBURNING FOR YOU, PT. 1: Remember the slogan \223Home Taping Is Killing Music\224? It held currency until everyone figured out that the people most likely to make cassette copies of their LPs or compile mix tapes were also the most devoted album-buying consumers. Not having learned from the past, the labels\222 latest bogeymen are CD burners and Internet file-swapping. By treating music fans like criminals while ratcheting up CD prices and hatching such user-unfriendly schemes as \223crippled\224 copy-protected discs, the industry has created a deeply adversarial relationship. It doesn\222t help that it dispatches its loyal minions to willfully dispense disinformation (as anyone who\222s kept up with RIAA headmistress Hilary Rosen\222s frequent spin doctoring, in what appears to be her willing venue of choice, USA Today, knows) and that the general public swallows the propaganda hook, line and sinker while the rest of us are left saying to ourselves, \223Do they really think we\222re that stupid?\224<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBURNING FOR YOU, PT. 2: Talk about music-industry spin-doctoring: In a recent issue of CMJ New Music Report V2 Records VP Of Sales Jim Kelly held forth at length (and unchallenged) as he discussed the oncoming snowball effect of file sharing and CD burning upon the artistic community. After a somewhat facile analysis of how commerce and art are interrelated, he summarized with the statement, \223People with families are suffering because of your greed.\224 That\222s quite leap of logic. As Samuel L. Jackson might put it, allow me to retort: No, Jim, artists and their kids are not starving because Joe Fratboy is out there utilizing this year\222s version of Napster. It\222s because the music industry bases its moves on unlimited profit, damn the torpedoes, and some of the collateral damage inflicted when those torpedoes go off is upon, unfortunately, \223suffering\224 artists not privy to multi-million-dollar recording contracts. True, record sales are way, way down in the industry. But genuine music lovers will always seek out new tunes and new artists; that\222s how we get our fixes, after all. And in general, people behave honestly as long as they feel they\222re getting a fair shake; it\222s just that the aforementioned adversarial relationship is so teeth-baring that it\222s gonna take more than just damage control to draw consumers back into the house. All those free DVD and secret website access keys are a nice touch, I\222ll admit. Now if the labels would just put as much time and energy into artist development as they do limited-edition packaging and value add-ons, we might start getting somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBURNING FOR YOU, PT.3: Veteran singer-songwriter Janis Ian took an insightful look at all this in a lengthy essay on music-biz matters for the June issue of Performing Songwriter. After it subsequently spread like wildfire across the Internet, she posted an even more incisive followup piece on her website (www.janisian.com) that read, in part, \223Do I believe downloading is not harming the music industry? Yes, absolutely. Do I think consumers, once the industry starts making product they want to buy, will still buy even though they can download? Yes. Water is free, but a lot of us drink bottled water because it tastes better. You can get coffee at the office, but you're likely to go to Starbucks or the local espresso place, because it tastes better. When record companies start making CDs that offer consumers a reason to buy them, we will buy them. The songs may be free on line, but the CDs will taste better.\224<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBURNING FOR YOU, PT. 4: Meanwhile, yours truly, stuck at home with cabin fever couldn\222t help but, as Keith Moon might put it, fiddling about. By now everyone knows how the record industry has been quietly releasing copy-protected discs into the marketplace, primarily in Europe but increasingly in the states, too. Apparently some Einstein realized that the reason CDs were finding their way onto the Internet before they were released commercially was because somebody in the pipeline was \226 duh \226 leaking \221em. Naturally that ethics-challenged demographic, music journalists, came under suspicion; since all we do is sit around all day, smoke weed and listen to records (and, oh yeah, occasionally earn a full time living at writing about the damn things), it\222s logical to assume that we spend all our discretionary hours uploading shit to the Web. Now, all those \223polite\224 letters from publicists accompanying review CDs suggesting that it would be bad karma for me to, like post tunes I didn\222t even ask for in the first place to the Internet wasn\222t enough; labels started sending out  copy-protected promotional review copies! (Dreamworks went old-school and serviced reviewers with cassettes of the new Swizz Beatz joint, G.H.E.T.T.O. Stories, but it wasn\222t like I was even gonna listen to that garbage in the first place, so I ran off 5000 copies with my dubbing deck, mocked up a cool j-card using clip art from the Web \226 minus the parental advisory -- and made a killing down at the local flea market selling the tapes to homeboys.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I received copy-protected discs of Butch (ex-Marvelous 3) Walker\222s Left of Self*Centered (Arista) and Good Charlotte\222s The Young & The Hopeless (Epic). Each had a sticker affixed that read, in part, \223This CD is protected against unauthorized copying\205 will not play on computers\205\224 Egad! Duly piqued but stifling the urge to call up the label publicists and tell them, \223Gee, I\222m awfully sorry, but I can\222t write about your artists because my office\222s primary listening device is my PC,\224 I started fiddling around with the old stereo. In practically no time I was able to burn analog CDR copies of both discs on my Phillips home audio (non-computer) burner. Then it was a simple matter to play the CDRs on my computer (and, if I\222d wanted to waste the blank discs, burn additional copies with the PC\222s burner), rip MP3s and email \221em to my friend Scott, an audio/video tech whiz, in San Francisco. Scott reports that the MP3s sound just fine to his ears, analog source or no analog source, and he might even go buy a copy of Butch\222s album. Before you ask, no, I didn\222t offer to burn him a copy. That would be wrong. (Incidentally, as long as we\222re talking analog, don\222t all those music-subscription sites the record industry is frantically test-marketing seem just a tad, um, restrictive when it comes to the number of MP3s your sub allows you to download and burn versus the number of tracks you only listen to in a streaming format such as RealAudio? Guess what, any monkey with a patch cord can record -- onto tape, or onto disc if you have a home audio burner  -- a stream, and in all honesty, it\222ll sound fine for casual listening unless you\222re a hopeless stereophile geek.) Oh, and speaking of the actual music, well, the Walker disc is medium-common-denominator pop/rock, while Good Charlotte is abysmal bubblegum punk. So much for them. I think I\222ve already traded \221em in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And as an interesting postscript, Yep Roc sent out advances of Paul Weller\222s Illumination, due early \22203, that were copy-protected. Touch & Go did likewise with the new Calexico, Feast Of Wire. On principle I was gonna refuse to review the discs \226 you listening out there, labels? \226 since I have better things to do with my time, and the 1,850+ promos I get annually, than to haul the stereo system down to the basement where my new office (and computer) is. Yep Roc wisely came through with a finished stock copy, however. Happy to report it\222s not copy-protected and I shall proceed with the Wellercentric verbiage posthaste. We\222ll see what happens with the Calexico release when stock copies surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBURNING FOR YOU, PT. 5: Back in the outside world while everyone was off to Mordor with Gandalf and Frodo battling the RIAA and its minions of evil, a previously unnoticed file-sharing network known as Soulseek (www.slsk.org ) was, like other players in the post-Napster milieu, back home at the Shire, quietly accumulating a grassroots base of users and acolytes. This time, however, there\222s a twist. Accurately noting, as have the major labels with their forays into subscription services (MusicNet, Pressplay, etc.), that people might actually cough up money to get reliable and consistent access to downloadable music, Soulseek began offering what it euphemistically calls \223download privileges\224 to its users. If you make at least a $5 \223donation\224 to Soulseek, that will allow you, for the next 30 days, to be bumped to the front of any online queue that forms when multiple users are trying to snag the same music; in other words, the folks who sign up for the Soulseek \223golden circle\224 get first dibs at the tunes ahead of the rest of us poor schnooks still clinging to the it\222s-so-nineties notion that music should be free. Ain\222t capitalism grand?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMUSIC HEADLINE OF THE YEAR: \22337 Record-Store Clerks Feared Dead In Yo La Tengo Concert Disaster.\224 Okay, so that appeared on the front page of the April 11-17 issue of The Onion. But with great satire often comes shiny kernels of reality, too. (Let\222s face it, every YLT show probably has at least 37 rec shop geeks in the audience.) And the accompanying photos of the \223dead\224 clerks were spot-on (call it the \223Elvis Costello syndrome,\224 physical appearances-wise), particularly since of them was the granddaddy of all record clerks, Mr. Lenny Kaye. \223As of press time,\224 wrote The Onion of the tragedy, \223police and emergency workers were still sifting through the wreckage for copies of Magnet, heated debates over the definition of emo, and other signs of record-store-clerk life.\224<br>\r\n<br>\r\nROCK CRITIC OF THE YEAR: Hyon Kim, a 40-year old Seattle man also known as \223The Sleater-Kinney Masturbator.\224 Seems the randy lad had been a bit too obvious when he went about \223walking the dog\224 at Seattle concerts, reportedly rubbing up against female patrons in the process (makes sense). So a local reporter and club security watched him during a September Sleater-Kinney show and nabbed him while he was busily polishing his hot rock. Kim was charged with indecent exposure and assault. The question that arises, of course, is what would have happened to Kim if this had been at a Donnas concert, given that the lithesome lasses practically incite audience dudes to \223stay up\224 all night with them? (I almost used this news clip as my \223Wanker Of The Year\224 entry, but that would be way too obvious\205)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOK OF THE YEAR:  2002 yielded the proverbial bumper crop of rock \221n\222 roll books. One remarkable connecting thread among the best of them: an intimate, you-are-there tenor. Thus we got behind-the-scenes peeks at the Grateful Dead (A Long Strange Trip, by longtime Dead publicist Dennis McNally), The Germs (Lexicon Devil, by Brendan Mullen, former operator of L.A. punk mecca The Masque), Lynyrd Skynyrd (Lynyrd Skynyrd, by band security chief Gene Odom), Tim Buckley (Blue Melody, by the late singer\222s guitarist Lee Underwood), Keith Moon (Keith Moon, by Dougal Butler, Moonie\222s personal assistant) \226 even a reissue of On the Road With Bob Dylan, journalist Larry \223Ratso\224 Sloman\222s celebrated backstage account of Dylan\222s 1975 \223Rolling Thunder Revue\224 tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was journalist Jimmy McDonough\222s outrageous and massively detailed 800-page marathon Shakey: Neil Young\222s Biography (Random House), however, that put you between the sheets with author and subject. 300 interviews \226 including 50 hours spent grilling Young -- spread across eight years yielded the most comprehensive accounting to date of the rocker. In particular, the creative peaks of the mid \22170s and early \22190s are exhaustively chronicled; the book\222s only downside is that the timeline comes to a close in \22298. Young attempted, for mysterious reasons, to shut down the project, leaving McDonough having to file suit to see the book through to publication. Yet McDonough himself, in an interview I conducted with him, is the first to admit that for all his blood, sweat and tears, his subject remained elusive in spirit. By way of example, he pointed to Young\222s modus operandi in assembling his long-delayed Archives box set as indicative of the man\222s mercurial personality. \223[The Archives  will appear] if the dream catcher doesn\222t fall off the rearview mirror and if the moon is in the seventh house and if Yoda blinks his eye twice!\224 said McDonough, laughing. \223There is no rhyme or reason! And I\222m sure if Mr. Young were standing here he\222d hit me in the head with [his guitar] Old Black for saying that. But believe me, whatever happens will happen when it happens and not earlier than when it happens. Nobody really has a clue right now. Not even [official Young archivist] Joel Bernstein. The phone call may come tomorrow: \221Hey Joel, it\222s Neil\226 we gotta get this out, what\222s the problem?\222 Yeah, right.\224 McDonough also hastened to add, however, that he wouldn\222t trade those eight years of research for anything in the world, saying, \223Sure, there were rocky patches. Let\222s face it, chaos surrounds the guy. But I still had the greatest adventure of my life and he let me do it!\224<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDVD OF THE YEAR: 2002 wasn\222t quite The Year That Music DVDs Broke. There were some superb offerings, of course, from the special edition version of Martin Scorsese\222s concert documentary on The Band, The Last Waltz, and the digital debut of the Channel 4 TV (Britain) Miles Davis doc The Miles Davis Story, to the 5.1 sound transfer of Neil Young\222s live-in-\22278 film Rust Never Sleeps and the combined DVD-CD package chronicling the Cowboy Junkies\222 2001 tour, Open Road. Not to mention the ultimate treatment of the Beatles\222 A Hard Day\222s Night, which added an entire second disc of wonderful supplemental material. But the DVD industry continues to overlook scores of classic concerts, docs and video anthologies, consigning them to VHS (or worse, Beta) limbo. Small wonder that the bootleggers have been transferring to DVD boatloads of rare material. Just two recent examples: Ladies And Gentlemen\205 The Rolling Stones, the Stones \22272 American trek; and Eat the Document, filmmaker D.A. Pennebaker\222s look at Dylan\222s legendary \22266 tour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPennebaker was also behind the lens for the hippie rock festival film Monterey Pop. That documentary, from 1968, of the \22167 gathering-of-tribes is now out as a three-DVD box set. The Complete Monterey Pop Festival (Criterion Collection) is pricey, around 75 bucks, but dig what you get: (1) the original film with a new digital transfer overseen by Pennebaker, plus a 5.1 audio mix courtesy noted engineer Eddie Kramer and assorted interviews, trailers and bonus material; (2) both Jimi Plays Monterey and Shake! Otis At Monterey, the complete sets (also in 5.1) from Hendrix and Redding; and (3) \223The Outtake Performances,\224 a whopping two hours\222 worth of film not seen in the original, tunes by The Who, The Mamas and The Papas, Byrds, Laura Nyro, Buffalo Springfield, Tiny Tim (1) and others. Just viewing the Hendrix set \226 guitar burning and all -- is enough to set your neck-hairs on end. Sound across all three discs is outstanding, and the menus are cleanly designed for easy navigation. A 64-page booklet crammed with color photos plus three essays (by Barney Hoskyns, Michael Lydon and Armond White) about the festival and the film rounds out the box set. Monterey Pop has always been a key festival film, holding its own against the likes of Woodstock and Message To Love: Isle of Wight Festival. In its new triple-DVD incarnation, it most likely stands as the definitive one. You can practically smell the patchouli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTUPID HUMAN TRICKS PT. 1: Sometime during the middle of 2002 it looked as if, thanks to legislation that was to impose a new schedule of federal copyright royalty fees upon broadcasters, small-time, mom-and-pops Webcasters \226 without a doubt, the true face of alternative programming \226 would have to shut down, unable to come up with the thousands of dollars that would be required under the law. (Even worse: the fees would be retroactive to 1998, upping the ante even higher.) No matter that the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel based its calculations \226 which came in initially at 14-hundredths of a cent per song per listener, later half that amount \226 on figures most noncommercial broadcasters, web-based or terrestrial agreed were flawed and inflated. (A number of Net radio stations did in fact shut down in anticipation of the crash.) Luckily, on Nov. 15, Congress approved a deal and passed the amended Small Webcaster Act of 2002. This followed lengthy and very vocal appeals from the broadcast and music community, a rare instance of grassroots democracy in action. Essentially, small Webcasters who take in less than $1 million in revenue each year \226 basically, just about everyone not tied to a commercial terrestrial station \226 were given a break on the digital-performance royalties that would have otherwise crippled them and shut them down.<br>\r\nGee, once in a while the good guys DO win!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTUPID HUMAN TRICKS PT. 2: Or do they? The \223Peer To Peer Privacy Prevention Act\224 is slated to come up sometime soon in \22203. Instigated by legislative flacks of the RIAA, it reportedly will give record labels the right to hack into individuals\222 computers to ferret out copyright violations, i.e., unauthorized downloaded music that was obtained by using peer-to-peer file-sharing networks. Don\222t laugh \226 the industry has already shut steamrolled over Napster and many of its ilk; private individuals, already seeing an erosion of privacy and personal rights under the name of anti-terrorism legislation, may be next. (Hint: If you use the Windows Media software to play music on your computer, read all the fine print in the user\222s end agreement, plus any similar text that arrives with updates from Microsoft. You may get a rude surprise.) Get those firewalls and virus protections fired up, folks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE LETTER THAT SPIN WON\222T PUBLISH: Gee, Spin, thanks a lot for all the hip reading in your February issue -- the one with cover stars Sum 41 acting, you know, all punk rock \221n\222 stuff. I mean, it was fascinating to learn how those lads\222 lads in Sum like to get wasted, do obnoxious things and talk about chicks\222 tits. And a hard-hitting Q&A with diva-in-training Kelly Osbourne \226 that hasn\222t been done since the January issue of Seventeen! Your Audioslave feature was kinda by the numbers, too \226 practically the same one a zillion other rock mags have run. I realize Chuck Klosterman penned the piece, but if you brought him on board as Senior Writer in order to Lester Bangs-ize the magazine you seriously need to consider getting your boy wonder fucked up before his interviews \226 have him go boozing with Sum 41, maybe? \226 because his shit\222s wearing thin. Fargo Rock City, the airless Spin editorial room ain\222t. I did have high hopes for the porn article on SuicideGirls.com \226 good stroke material is always welcome at my doublewide \226 but dammit, it was just more sistahs-are-doin\222-it-for-themselves self-empowerment p.c. blather. Gene Simmons Tongue (or even Penthouse) wouldn\222t have dropped that ball! Come to think of it, Punk Planet ran an extensive feature on SuicideGirls.com a few issues back. Are your writers coming up with this stuff all by their lonesome, or is there a single editor we can blame on the content nosedive? I\222m thinking that things maybe seemed a little grim for ya after Alan \223I Like To Be Interviewed By VH1\224 Light split to hatch his own mag. But you went through some no-lookee/no-touchee dark days back when Guce, Jr. was in charge, and you bounced back from that. You guys are professionals, right? Who\222s running the Spin ship?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd am I just getting senile, or has your reviews section in the back shrunk in direct proportion to the increase in celeb-watch crap in the front? I mean, c\222mon \226 eleven friggin\222 new release reviews in a music magazine?!? Who hid the Spin mission statement? Who stole the ding-dong soul? But back to the Sum 41 cover. You couldn\222t even get that right, could you, Spin?  Yes, yes, yes \226 I knew the minute I saw it on the Bi-Lo newsstand that it was supposed to be a nod to that cream pie-splattered first Damned album sleeve from \22277. (It would have been funnier if you\222d done Eddie & The Hot Rods, but that\222s just me.) So who was the rocket scientist in charge of approving the photo that was used? \221Cos if Sum\222s Jay McCaslin is s\222posed to be playing Captain Sensible, he forgot to put on his goofy \223punk\224 shades \226 oh, wait, I forgot, he\222s the resident doe-eyed, spiky-haired heart-throb of the group. (Gotta shift copies of your mag to the T.R.L. crowd, eh?) And I hasten to point out, as was pointed out to me by a fellow scribe, that as recently as last year Alternative Press had the same fucking idea: the June A.P. cover featured Blink-182 and Green Day all creamed- and punked-up, Damned-LP style. Are there any original ideas being floated at Spin meetings? Speaking of Alternative Press,  I\222d rag on you, Spin, some more, for your Readers Poll 2002 (Strokes, White Stripes, Weezer and Gwen Stefani, good; Creed, Britney, Christina, Avril, Pink, bad \226 now that\222s some serious out-of-the-box thinking by your readers!), except someone just handed me a copy of the new A.P. Christ almighty, Good Charlotte practically sweeps the A.P. Readers Poll. Weren\222t those same readers into like, Korn and Marilyn Manson five minutes ago? Actually, isn\222t A.P. the mag that used to cover the Flaming Lips, Robyn Hitchcock and Fugazi until it hitched its wagon to the Lollapaloser bandwagon, then to the rap-metal bandwagon, and now\205 Sigh. To paraphrase the New York Dolls, I\222m having a personality crisis just thinking about all this. It must be hell, being a Spin or A.P. writer, sitting around in your most private moments, realizing that the folks who are gonna read your stuff comprise a teenage wasteland of mooks, mouth-breathers and morons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpin, I know I\222m kinda shooting ducks in a barrel here. You\222ve sucked for some time, and besides, given the appalling state of mainstream rock journalism right now, criticizing you and your ilk is sooo 1990s. That said, a lot of us remember when you were a credible fount of information and opinion, before you sacrificed your core aesthetic (read: taking pride in being ahead of the curve) at the altar of lifestyle advertising. I\222m not sure if kids these days even realize they\222re being pandered to \226 maybe they\222re too busy hanging out at Hot Topic and soaking up Xbox and Nintendo radiation, I dunno \226 but someone needs to point it out to them. But it doesn\222t speak well of you, Spin, when one of your own contributors (who shall remain anonymous because he wants to keep his job) emails me and confides, \223Okay, you\222re right. I\222m not even defensive about this anymore. I\222m writing for idiots. And I mean that in both senses of the word \221for\222 \226 readers and editors. They\222re floundering here and are desperate \226 you\222ve noticed how much the magazine has shrunk, haven\222t you? All the ads are going to the Maxim clones. But I dunno, the pay is still okay here, and the resume looks good, relatively speaking.  Hey, you want to finally get that zine we were talking about going?\224 Indeed I do. Where\222s Creem when we need it the most? I hear some good rumors, though\205 Love, Fred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI WANT MY VH1 CLASSIC: You know, fuck MTV and the increasingly dire VH1. I want my goddam VH1 Classic. Switch on that channel and you can see everything from super-rare clips of \22160s and \22170s bands (many of the clips are from overseas sources) to all those guilty-pleasure video classics from the \22180s and early \22190s. Granted, there\222s an oversampling of silly haircut groups from the fabulous dawn of the MTV era, but hey, one man\222s \223Too Shy\224 by Kajagoogoo is another man\222s \223Mexican Radio\224 by Wall Of Voodoo. Plus, I have a certain weakness for that Pet Shop Boys-Dusty Springfield duet\205<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOTLEGS? WE DON\222T NEED NO STEENKIN\222 BOOTLEGS!: Let\222s be clear about our terminology: any self-respecting, anal-retentive, obsessive-compulsive \223music lover\224 knows that bootlegs are unauthorized concert recordings and/or unreleased studio material compiled and issued clandestinely by shadowy record labels not associated with the actual artist. And as fascinating as all those mix-up juxtapositions that flooded the clubs and download sites this year are (such as Freelance Hellraiser\222s \223Stroke Of Genius\224 which married Christina Aguilera to The Strokes), to call them \223bootlegs\224 is to sully the venerable name of the old guard. I mean, the term \223bootleg\224 was copyrighted (figuratively speaking) as far back as Dylan\222s Great White Wonder and the Stones\222 Live\222r Than You\222ll Ever Be, so all you deejay mooks, I\222m sorry, but you can\222t have it. We got there first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBEYOND THE VALLEY OF FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE: As long as we\222re talking bootlegs, however, a it turns out, bands have begun getting savvy along with the fans, too; perhaps it started in the early \22190s when the Grateful Dead tapped into a huge market by issuing live recordings on disc as part of its best-selling Dick\222s Picks series. Then a couple of years ago Pearl Jam picked up the ball by releasing almost every show from the Binaural tour on CD. Ditto Phish, who by the end of 2002 had reached Volume 16 in its Live Phish series. And say what you will about The Who\222s post-Entwistle tour this year: by not only releasing every show from its 2002 North American tour but directing all profits of The Who\222s Live 2002 Encore Series  to various charities of its choice, the band provided an admirable service to both fans and community. Other groups did the deed online via various strategies, either by tacitly approving of fans\222 live file-swapping activities or by posting a wealth of free live downloads on their official sites. Gee, groups who actually think about what their fanbase \226 the folks who pay their bills \226 wants! Who\222d a thunk it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWMN N RCK: Nobody blinked an eye when Vanity Fair turned the cover for its annual Music Issue into a veritable babes-in-arms solidarity session. Maybe it was because Gwen, J.Lo, Sheryl, Eve, Debbie Harry, et al actually fit the assigned billing \226 \223music\224 \226 or possibly because there was some serious cheekiness afoot with Barry White appearing on the same cover with the nine luscious ladies, ostensibly as their pimp daddy. But of course, it was intended to be ironic, and it was funny as hell to boot. Not so the cheerless, Photoshopped cover of Rolling Stone\222s \223Women In Rock\224 issue. It came as no surprise when, in late November, an open letter to Rolling Stone about the matter was posted on veteran grrrl-rocker Joan Jett\222s website (www.joanjett.com ). Penned by Maya Price, a musician friend of Jett\222s, the missive took to task the once-relevant rock-culture barometer, likening  the \223WIR\224 issue to a T&A Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition. You could practically hear tooth fillings rattle from coast to coast, so earnest was the collective nodding of the heads of music lovers.  Wrote Price, seething at the inclusion of the pop-lite likes of Shakira, Britney and Avril Lavigne under the banner \223Rock,\224 \223By R.S.  standards, Rock is no longer a style of music but a trendy costume to be whipped up by expensive stylists. If the issue had been called \221Some Cute Girls with Top 10 Records out Right Now,\222\205 I would have no beef with it. [But] corny as it may sound, ROCK is something which is still meaningful and even sacred to some of us.\224 Later, after I expressed my appreciation to Price for calling things like a lot of us saw \221em, Price wrote me back, saying, \223Apparently my sentiments are shared so widely that this thing grew wings and got around on its own. I have gotten so much positive feedback\205 I know \221touching\222 is a strange word to describe what either of us had to say, but you really can't imagine how powerfully moving it is when people really GET IT.\224 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTELEVISION DRAMA OF THE YEAR (PT.1): Hands down, it was The Bruce Springsteen Show.  Look, there he is, The Boss, up at the crack of dawn on July 30, appearing on NBC\222s Today, which broadcasts The E Street Band live from the Asbury Park Convention Center. During the day both MSNBC and CNN air their own Springsteen reports, and \226 whoops, there\222s the guy again, chatting about The Rising with Ted Koppel for ABC\222s Nightline and Nightline: Up Close. The Koppel interview continues the following night, and by Thursday and Friday Bruce has marched his E Streeters over to CBS to do couple of tunes on The Late Show With David Letterman. See Bruce. See Dave. See Bruce kibitz with Dave! What, no time that afternoon to drop in and say howdy to Oprah, too, Bruce? (If it was good enough for Bono\205.) As Eric Alterman, who wrote the \22299 Boss book It Ain\222t No Sin to be Glad You\222re Alive, quipped in The Nation, \223I half expected him to duet with Elmo or Big Bird over breakfast.\224 Later, Bruce would be the subject of MTV2\222s new Kurt Loder-hosted interview show \223The Table\224 on August 20, while the E Streeters would open the MTV Video Music Awards on August 29 and appear as the musical guest on the October 5 season premiere of \223Saturday Night Live.\224 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, matters of new-release promotion aside (and as Tom Petty has rightly noted in interviews this year, there just ain\222t no sure thing even for old superstars anymore, given the calcification of commercial radio, so it only makes sense to avail oneself of other media outlets), it\222s always a treat to see Bruce on the tube. On December 11 he closed out his year with one helluva bang and a holler. Appearing on the Conan O\222Brien show, he and the E Streeters, along with members of Conan\222s house band (which, as you know, is headed up by Bruce\222s drummer, mighty Max Weinberg), burned down the NBC studios with a you-hadda-be-there version of \223Kitty\222s Back\224 \226 nearly 10 minutes\222 worth, horns and all, pure fratrock-cum-jazzcat jive par excellence. (Now I know what Steve Van Zandt meant when, during an interview I conducted with him this year, he pointed out that all the guys in the band share the same frat and pop and garage roots, that its in their DNA, and that they can swing on command.) Live TV just don\222t get no better than this folks \226 and then they launch into \223Merry Christmas, Baby\224 which ended with Bruce running through the crowd and tossing out Xmas candy. Merry Christmas, baby, indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTELEVISION DRAMA OF THE YEAR (PT.2): Technically, I\222m fudging a bit here; I saw this spot in early January, but since that\222s when I\222m writing this, the judges have said they\222ll allow it\205.Sweet dreams are made of this. Following a cursory intro of the band from the late-night talk show host, they\222re off with a vengeance -- pumping bass figure, four-to-the-floor drum pattern, pounding ivories and a \223Street Fighting Man\224-like clarion call of guitars. The vocalist grabs the mic, gestures dramatically, and opens his mouth wide. The song is \223Sister Surround\224 and it\222s the key track from Behind The Music, the third longplayer from Sweden\222s The Soundtrack Of Our Lives. TSOOL deploys an impressive front line. To the right is one guitarist, strutting and stomping, his matted blonde shag \221do, scruffy facial hair and surly pout making him resemble Kurt Cobain. Beside him, the baby-faced Bobby Gillespie-look-alike bassist aims his axe skyward, as if lobbing mortar rounds in the direction of Dave. Across the way, next to the keyboard player, is the other guitarist, and while he bears an uncanny resemblance to the Stooges\222 James Williamson, he\222s got a Pete Townshend thing seriously happening, right down to his Union Jack jacket and his windmills on a vintage Gibson SG. And at stage center is the bearded bear of a lead singer \226 bizarrely, a dead ringer for Brian Wilson during the bathrobes-and-therapy days \226 who is doling out rock star poses in equal measures of irony and charisma. Like his bandmates, he\222s working this coveted Letterman shot for all its worth. \223Sister Surround,\224 with its Stones/Who/Sex Pistols muscularity -- all insistent riffing, fist-thrusting rhythms and insidious \223doo-de-doo-doo\224 backing vocals -- is memorable enough on album, a natural radio add in a just world. Performed live, however, with the added visual punch outlined above, it elevates SOOL to near-iconic status. No way can a rock fan view this 3 \275 minute display of punk-fueled vim and classic-rock vigor and not get chicken skin. SOOL gleefully and unselfconsciously kick out the jams like teens holed in the garage discovering their nascent powers. It\222s a purer-than-pure rock \221n\222 roll moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWANKER OF THE YEAR: It was pretty close, I\222ll admit. Ryan \223Cryin\222\224 Adams (or Ryan \223Rhymin\222 Ryman\224 Adams, take your pick) almost nabbed the award for all the fights he picked, ranging from his verbal war with Magnet (where I toil as one of the editors \226 Adams called out one of our writers, Corey Dubrowa, for interviewing friends and former band members) to his on-stage blow-up at the Ryman Auditorium (after some joker hollered out for a Bryan Adams cover, Mr. Petulant demanded that the paying customer be removed from the room) to his diatribe against White Stripes\222 Jack White (supposedly a one-time \223friend\224 of Adams \226 gee, with friends like that\205) in the British press. But then professional Jerry Lawler published his autobiography and we learned that he and Adams got together and staged all the antics, so\205 I digress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile some have called it a public meltdown of W. Axl Rose\222s that rivals those of Mariah or Jacko,  the concert no-shows of Rose and the subsequent collapse of the Guns N\222 Roses Chinese Democracy pre-tour could all be likened, perhaps, to the tour that Diana Ross mounted in 2000 with her \223Supremes\224 only to shut it down prematurely due to poor ticket sales. Seems that Gunners dates weren\222t even yielding half-full arenas, so a miffed, image-paranoid Axl decided to take his ball and go home. Not that he demonstrated any behavior along the way \226 other than not knowing his own lyrics and demonstrating a rather, uhh, unique grooming style for the tour \226 that could be construed as off the wall. Not to mention \226 STOP PRESS: On December 30, La Diva herself, Miss Ross, was picked up for DUI in Tucson, Arizona, the same fine southwestern \221burg that I called home for 10 years until returning home to NC in 2001. Coincidence? I think NOT.  No word on whether Axl, clearly in need of some extensive r&r (electroshock wouldn\222t hurt too, along with a barber) will be \223vacationing\224 at Canyon Ranch, the Tucson-based fat farm (aka rehab center) where Ross bunked all last May. But he should. At any rate, with that, my little droogies, we have the perfect note upon which to end this wonderful, wacky, crazy year. Axl, lose the braids, dude. Ryan, grow the fuck up. Jesse Helms, don\222t let the door hit you in the ass when you leave the Senate\205. Wait, how\222d Helms get into this rant?\205 And get well soon, Diana, but take good care. As we all know, you just can\222t hurry love.<br>\r\n")

Public Nuisance was Sacramento's Mod-est and Pop-est freak band, more melodic than Oxford Circle and harder hitting than New Breed.  But they had the same great mystique and material as world class bands such as the Creation and the Misunderstood.

  "2002 might've been a banner year for music (though I'll reserve judgement 'til I read the lists from my esteemed fellow Chuggers), but it wasn't necessarily a banner year for me. Tumultous problems with work and home kept me from following the highs and lows of what's been happening in the music industry.<br> It's probably telling that several records that will inevitably hit a lot of yr lists are only just coming across my desk now (so <i>this</i> is Interpol?). <br> I will say that this has been one of the more rock-oriented lists since I started compiling my annual top 10's or 20's. Maybe it's nostalgia. More likely a re-discovery of the unbridled majesty of the air guitar art form."

And I just can't stop playing it.  I\r\ncould try and explain why this is my favorite album of the year and the\r\nDonnas don't even make my radar, but you'd probably just call me a\r\nhypocrite.\r\n")
   ("Don Lennon"
    "Downtown"
    "Secretly Canadian"
    "An album that contains two songs about Dave Matthews mixed in with tunes\r\nabout Lenny Kravitz and gay nightlife doesn't necessarily sound like\r\nsure-fire winner to me either.  But Don captures more humor and insight into\r\nhumanity with a few quick lines than most songwriters muster up in their\r\ncareer.  It's irony-free irony, both fun and thought-provoking.  While not\r\nas good as his previous disc \"Maniac\" it's more than good enough.\r\n")

Perhaps\r\nthat's why I'm tabbing this January release instead of his newest one.\r\nThere's always one enchanting hit beckoning for those initial repeat\r\nlistens, filled with warm cellos and yearning vocals.  Then one by one the\r\nother tracks start to bubble through and from what was a song comes an album\r\nthat works beautifully from beginning to end.  I even love the crickets.\r\n")

    "Usually I save the re-issues for a special category near the end, but this\r\none's too good to relegate to the end of this e-mail.  Plus, this album was\r\nnever officially released in the US until this year.  At least that's my\r\nrationale.  The Action were an EMI band back in the 60's which caught the\r\nfancy of the mods and nobody else (at least nobody who bought 45's).  In a\r\ndesperate attempt to stay on the label they recorded demos of this album,\r\nfor which they received a pink slip.  It vacillates between sharp pop,\r\namusing prog and breathtaking psych with simplistic repetitive lyrics.  But\r\nsomehow it all holds together.\r\n")
   ("Josh Ritter"
    "The Golden Age Of Radio"

    "The majority of this album focuses on Josh ... his voice, his lyrics, his\r\nguitar.  There's very little embellishment of these pretty country-folk\r\ntunes, just a simple yet beguiling delivery and a couple of instruments.\r\nThe handful of full band tracks shine just as brightly, and in the end I'm\r\nleft wondering if their presence on the whole record would be an\r\nimprovement.  But I'm not one to quibble when an album is as good as this\r\none is.\r\n")

Patient, repetitive, serene, crushing ... all adjectives that fit\r\nperfectly with their retro 60's orch-pop style.  They never seem to expend\r\nmuch energy yet somehow generate a potent charge.  On first listen this\r\nsophomore release isn't as captivating as their previous effort, but over\r\ntime it settles into its own version of the formula and finds its own\r\nslightly different path.\r\n")

Strange that one kid described it as 'emo' to me.\r\n")

    "There's still plenty of great power pop being produced out there, strange\r\nthat my favorite album in the genre this year is by the lead singer of the\r\nOld 97's.  Though when you seen Jon Brion's name next to the producer credit\r\nI suppose I should know what I'm in for ... after all that's why I purchased\r\nthe record.  And a fun romp it is, there are a couple of stunners, no real\r\nletdowns and plenty of tunes about girls and other things he can't keep away\r\nfrom.\r\n")

    "Aesthetics"
    "Considering their penchant for instrumentals on previous releases I was\r\nquite surprised to find an album full of ... well ... songs with lyrics.\r\nWhile still occupying the space between math and slow-core, WftD added\r\nvocals and found that they work better with instead of without.  The music\r\nseems to carry more feeling (hence the title?), and one track in particular\r\nsounds like dead-on early New Order.  I was surprised to find myself\r\nbranching out from that familiar starting point, eventually drawing\r\nenjoyment from every track on the disc.\r\n")

    "If the late 70's sounds of Joe Jackson, Cheap Trick or Nick Lowe don't\r\nentrance you then you should probably let this one pass you by.  But if you\r\nstill reach out for that old copy of \"I'm The Man\" here's one of the best\r\nknock-offs of that sound.  Filled with stinging guitar solos, howling\r\nchoruses and a short running time, this effort never failed to satisfy when\r\nI had that rock-n-roll jones.\r\n")

While the Smiths made you wonder how the heck you could continue\r\non, My Favorite plow through the mediocrity of life with their head down and\r\nstill somehow survive.  Joe Pernice once gave us the choice between graduate\r\nschool and suicide, My Favorite picked the former but still remember why\r\nanyone would opt for the latter.\r\n")

    "If you don't have any Goblin records then you want to forgo this temporarily\r\n(it's just not typical of their material) and get Suspiria first. But\r\nif you already have at least one Goblin album, then get this one now.\r\nOf course, at first you had to be a little trepidacious about Il\r\nFantastico Viaggio Del Bagarozzo Mark, released in 1978, for the\r\nfollowing reasons: [1] it's one of only two Goblin albums that\r\nweren't commissioned as soundtracks (the other being Roller), and [2]\r\nit's also supposedly their only album with *vocals*. Coulda crashed\r\nand burned if you ask me, but it turns out this album is awesome and\r\nthe vocals just send it over the top! Massimo Morante's voice is\r\ndramatic and urgent yet at the very same time super melodic. And it\r\nsort of makes sense that without filmic visuals to provide visible\r\nstimulation, the vocals provide just the right amount of narrative\r\n\"human\" element. The songs here are so melodic and hook-filled, with\r\ntremendously beautiful minor-key climaxes that really satisfy. So\r\ngreat!\r\n      Comes with mpeg footage of the band (in 2001) playing music in\r\nthe same Cinevox studio where they'd always recorded, and also\r\nthere's a rare interview where they reveal that much of Il Fantastico\r\nViaggio Del Bagarozzo Mark is about saying no to drugs.")
   ("Blast Furnace"
    "s/t"
    "Long Hair"
    "Copenhagen's rock scene in the early 1970s was so small and fertile that bands formed and reformed in various combinations of the same people. Case in point -- Blast Furnace came together in 1970, released a single great LP in 1971, and by 1972 3/4 of Blast Furnace had joined the band Culpepper's Orchard. It's kind of amazing that this record has been lost to all but the most die hard fans of Danish progressive rock, because it's so clearly great. The angst-filled (almost Faust-ish) vocals of Brit singer Tom McEwan take turns with super-expressive organ lines. And there are flutes eveywhere (which fills our flute obsessive Andee with joy).\r\n      And the arrangements are really good, making the most of minor key melodies so that nothing need be overstated. There aren't extended wanky instrumental passages here, for a prog band Blast Furnace edited themselves so well, leaving us wanting more. And, in fact, there is more -- a non-album track intended as a single has also been included on this cd. The disc starts off as classic and firece seventies prog, with complex melodic passages and some instrumental spacy jamming, but as the record progresses, the record veers dramatically from mostly instrumental prog, to super dramatic, almost goofy (in a good way) balladeering. The vocalist's deep baritone waxes poetic on ridiculous and far out subject matters, like the plight of Toytown, or poor sad Bobo the Clown. Sounds silly, and it sort of is, but it's really really good. Reminds us a little of AQ faves Paternoster (although not nearly as insane) or some super melodramatic seventies singer songwriter. But the combination of heartfelt ballads and searing prog action make this a weird and great find.")

Too many people have lobbed the term \223boring\224 at this one, and it\222s certainly an easy mistake to make with only a cursory listen or two; give it the proper amount of ear time, and you start to notice the little things, like how the guitar interplay is the best the band has had in YEARS, and how the lyrics evoke all of the post-WTC emotional fallout without giving it away altogether. (After all, you gotta maintain some mystery, aintcha?) ")
   ("Delgados"

The band somehow even managed to avoid having Dave Fridmann\222s immediately-recognizable production style turn into a liability by using it even more effectively than the Flaming Lips did with Yoshimi (nicely circumventing any potential accusations of trying to knock off The Soft Bulletin, too). Desperation has never ever sounded so beautiful. ")

If you stick around, you\222ll find someone who has a wonderful grip on the language and isn\222t afraid to throw around similes; and, when it comes right down to it the sparseness of most of the material is perfectly fitting for an album that details the implosion of a marriage\205surely a time when you\222ll feel more alone than you ever have before.")
